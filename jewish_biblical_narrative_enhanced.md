## Part 1: Primeval History

### Historical and Cultural Background: Primeval History

**Historical Context (Creation to Tower of Babel (~Creation - 2000 BCE))**

The Primeval History narratives (Genesis 1-11) describe creation, early humanity, the flood, and the dispersion of nations. These accounts share significant parallels with other ancient Near Eastern literature, particularly Mesopotamian texts. The Epic of Gilgamesh contains a flood narrative strikingly similar to Noah's flood, while the Enuma Elish presents Babylonian creation theology. The Sumerian King List describes antediluvian rulers with extraordinarily long reigns, paralleling Genesis's genealogies. Archaeological evidence from Mesopotamian sites shows continuous cultural development from the Ubaid period (5900-4000 BCE) through the Uruk period (4000-3100 BCE) when the first cities emerged, and into the Early Dynastic period (2900-2350 BCE). Scholars debate whether Genesis 1-11 represents literal history, theological mythology, or ancient historiography shaped by later Israelite theology. The Tower of Babel narrative corresponds archaeologically to Mesopotamian ziggurats, massive stepped temple towers constructed throughout Sumer and Akkad, with the best-preserved example being the ziggurat of Ur (c. 2100 BCE). Dating these narratives remains contentious, with traditional chronologies placing creation around 4004 BCE (Ussher) while critical scholarship sees these as etiological narratives composed during or after the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) drawing on older Mesopotamian traditions.

**Geographic Setting**

The events of the Primeval History are set in the ancient Near East, specifically in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) and its surrounding regions. The Garden of Eden narrative references four rivers - the Pishon, Gihon, Tigris (Hiddekel), and Euphrates - suggesting a location in the Fertile Crescent between the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys. The flood narrative describes a universal deluge centered in this same Mesopotamian heartland. Archaeological evidence shows that catastrophic flooding did occur in ancient Mesopotamia; excavations at Ur revealed an 11-foot flood deposit dated to approximately 2900 BCE, though regional rather than global. The Tower of Babel account explicitly places events in "the land of Shinar," identified with ancient Sumer in southern Mesopotamia where cities like Eridu, Ur, Uruk, and Babylon developed. The geographic scope expands through the Table of Nations (Genesis 10), describing dispersion throughout the ancient Near East from Egypt and Canaan westward to Japheth's descendants in the Aegean regions, and eastward to Elam (modern Iran) and beyond, encompassing the known world of ancient Israel.

**Cultural Context**

Daily life during the period reflected in Genesis 1-11 corresponds to early Mesopotamian civilization. The text describes the transition from nomadic pastoralism (Cain and Abel) to settled agriculture and urbanization (Cain building a city, Genesis 4:17). Technological development is evidenced through references to metalworking (Tubal-Cain as "forger of bronze and iron," Genesis 4:22) corresponding to the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Ages. Social structures in early Mesopotamia included extended family units (clans), emerging kingship (the Nephilim and "mighty men," Genesis 6:4), and specialized labor evidenced by the Tower of Babel's organized construction project. Marriage customs included monogamy and polygamy, with Lamech noted as the first recorded polygamist (Genesis 4:19). Archaeological evidence from Uruk-period Mesopotamia (4000-3100 BCE) shows the emergence of social stratification, specialized crafts, and proto-writing systems (cuneiform), reflecting the cultural complexity implied in Genesis. The flood narrative preserves details about ancient shipbuilding, animal husbandry, and the importance of covenant relationships. Longevity claims in the genealogies (Methuselah living 969 years, Genesis 5:27) parallel Mesopotamian king lists but exceed them dramatically, with scholarly explanations ranging from rhetorical hyperbole to different calendar systems or corrupted numerical transmission.

**Political Context**

The political landscape described in Genesis 1-11 reflects the earliest stages of human governance and organization. Initially, no formal political structures exist beyond patriarchal family leadership (Adam, Seth, Noah as heads of households). The narrative of Nimrod (Genesis 10:8-12) describes the emergence of kingship and empire-building, with Nimrod establishing his kingdom in Shinar (Babylon, Erech/Uruk, Akkad) and Assyria (Nineveh, Calah), corresponding to early Mesopotamian city-states. Archaeological evidence from the Uruk period shows the development of centralized authority, monumental architecture (temples and palaces), and administrative bureaucracy evidenced by early cuneiform tablets recording economic transactions. The Tower of Babel narrative reflects ancient concerns about imperial overreach and divine sovereignty versus human ambition, possibly commenting on the Babylonian Empire's later dominance. The Table of Nations (Genesis 10) presents an early ethnographic map describing the political geography of the ancient Near East, with the sons of Noah representing major people groups: Shem (Semitic peoples including Assyrians, Arameans, Hebrews), Ham (African and Canaanite peoples), and Japheth (Indo-European peoples including Greeks and Anatolians). This political taxonomy reflects Israel's understanding of neighboring nations and empires during the monarchic or exilic period when Genesis was likely edited into final form.

**Economic Context**

The economy described in early Genesis reflects the progression from hunter-gatherer subsistence to pastoralism, agriculture, and eventually urban economies. Abel represents pastoral nomadism (shepherding), while Cain represents settled agriculture, reflecting the actual historical transition that occurred during the Neolithic Revolution (c. 10,000-8000 BCE in the Fertile Crescent). Archaeological evidence from sites like Jericho and Çatalhöyük shows this transition from foraging to farming. Technological innovations mentioned include metalworking (bronze and iron, Genesis 4:22), corresponding to the Bronze Age (3300-1200 BCE) and emerging Iron Age (1200 BCE onward). The text references musical instruments (lyre and pipe, Genesis 4:21), indicating cultural sophistication and specialized crafts. Economic organization in early Mesopotamian cities included temple and palace economies managing agricultural surplus, craft production, and long-distance trade. Evidence from Uruk shows trade networks extending to Anatolia (for obsidian and metals), Afghanistan (for lapis lazuli), and the Gulf region (for precious stones and timber). The Tower of Babel narrative describes organized labor and resource mobilization for monumental construction, using "brick for stone and slime for mortar" (Genesis 11:3), accurately reflecting Mesopotamian building materials and techniques where stone was scarce and mud brick with bitumen mortar was standard. The Table of Nations implicitly describes economic spheres of influence and trade relationships among ancient peoples.

**Religious Context**

The religious practices and theological themes of Genesis 1-11 establish foundational concepts for biblical theology while reflecting ancient Near Eastern religious contexts. The creation narratives present monotheism (one God creating all things) in contrast to Mesopotamian polytheism (multiple deities in cosmic conflict, as in Enuma Elish), though some scholars see remnants of polytheism in plural forms like "Let us make man" (Genesis 1:26). Worship practices initially involve direct divine-human interaction (God walking in Eden, Genesis 3:8; speaking with Cain, Genesis 4:9-15) without formal priesthood or temples. The first altar and sacrifice appear with Noah after the flood (Genesis 8:20), establishing the practice of burnt offerings. The concept of covenant emerges with Noah (Genesis 9:8-17), introducing a theological framework that shapes all subsequent biblical theology. Key theological themes include: creation ex nihilo (out of nothing, though Genesis 1:2 describes pre-existing chaos), human beings as imago Dei (image of God, Genesis 1:26-27), the fall and origin of sin (Genesis 3), divine judgment and grace (flood narrative), and divine sovereignty over human affairs (Babel). The genealogies (toledoth structure) emphasize divine providence in human history, tracing the line from Adam through Seth to Noah to Shem to Abraham. Comparisons with Mesopotamian religion highlight both similarities (flood narratives, divine councils, temple building) and distinctions (ethical monotheism versus capricious polytheism, humans created in God's image versus slaves to serve gods). These narratives likely served to establish Israelite identity and theological distinctiveness against the dominant Mesopotamian religious culture.

## Genesis

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Genesis covers the longest chronological span of any biblical book, from creation through approximately 1500 BCE (late date) or 1800 BCE (early date) with Joseph's death in Egypt. Traditional Jewish and Christian scholarship dates the composition to Moses during the wilderness period (15th-13th century BCE). However, critical scholarship, particularly the Documentary Hypothesis developed by Julius Wellhausen, proposes composition from multiple sources (J, E, P, D) written between the 10th and 5th centuries BCE and compiled during or after the Babylonian exile. The Documentary Hypothesis identifies distinct literary strands: the Yahwist source (J, 10th century BCE), Elohist (E, 9th century BCE), Deuteronomist (D, 7th century BCE), and Priestly source (P, 6th-5th century BCE). Conservative scholars maintain Mosaic authorship with possible later editorial updates. The patriarchal narratives (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob) are traditionally dated to the Middle Bronze Age II period (2000-1550 BCE), though archaeological correlation remains debated, with some scholars questioning the historical existence of the patriarchs while others see them as historical figures embedded in legendary material.

**Author and Audience:** Traditional authorship attributes Genesis to Moses, based on ancient Jewish tradition, statements in the Pentateuch itself (Exodus 17:14, Numbers 33:2), and New Testament references (Mark 12:26, Luke 24:27, John 5:46). This view holds that Moses compiled earlier oral traditions and possibly written sources into a coherent narrative during Israel's wilderness wanderings, writing for the newly liberated Hebrew people to establish their identity and covenant relationship with Yahweh. Critical scholarship challenges Mosaic authorship, pointing to anachronisms (references to "Philistines" before their arrival, Genesis 21:32; mention of "Ur of the Chaldeans" using a term from the 1st millennium BCE, Genesis 11:28), linguistic features suggesting later Hebrew, and theological development inconsistent with Moses's era. The documentary hypothesis proposes multiple authors/editors working across centuries, with the Priestly editor(s) giving final shape to the text during or after the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE). The intended audience, according to this view, was post-exilic Israel seeking to understand their identity, covenant relationship, and place among the nations. Both traditional and critical perspectives agree that Genesis serves to answer fundamental questions: Who are we? Where did we come from? Why do we exist? What is our relationship to God and other nations?

**Key Themes:** Genesis develops foundational theological and narrative themes that shape all subsequent Scripture. **Creation and Providence:** God as sovereign creator of all things, working purposefully through history (Genesis 1-2, 50:20). **Fall and Sin:** Human rebellion and its consequences, establishing the problem that redemption must solve (Genesis 3-11). **Covenant:** God's initiative to establish binding relationships with humans, particularly through Noah (Genesis 9) and Abraham (Genesis 12, 15, 17), introducing the covenantal framework central to biblical theology. **Election and Promise:** God's choosing of Abraham and his descendants to be a blessing to all nations (Genesis 12:1-3), establishing the Abrahamic covenant with promises of land, descendants, and blessing. **Faith and Obedience:** Abraham's faith credited as righteousness (Genesis 15:6), serving as the model for faith in both Jewish and Christian traditions. **Blessing and Curse:** The pattern of divine blessing for obedience and consequences for disobedience. **Providence in History:** God working through human choices and even evil intentions to accomplish his purposes (Joseph narrative, Genesis 37-50). **Family and Lineage:** The importance of genealogy and family continuity, tracing the line from Adam to the twelve tribes of Israel. These themes establish the theological foundation for understanding Israel's identity, God's character, and humanity's relationship to the divine.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Archaeological evidence provides mixed correlation with Genesis narratives. For the Patriarchal period, discoveries include: **Mari Tablets** (18th century BCE) describing customs paralleling patriarchal practices (adoption, inheritance, marriage customs). **Nuzi Tablets** (15th century BCE) similarly reflect social customs found in Genesis. **Middle Bronze Age sites** in Canaan show cultural continuity with the period described. The **Ebla Tablets** (24th century BCE) include place names mentioned in Genesis. However, direct archaeological confirmation of the patriarchs remains elusive. The cities mentioned (Ur, Haran, Shechem, Hebron) existed in antiquity, and personal names like Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph are attested in ancient Near Eastern texts, though not these specific individuals. For the Joseph narrative in Egypt, the **Beni Hasan tomb paintings** (c. 1900 BCE) show Asiatic peoples entering Egypt, consistent with patriarchal migrations. **Egyptian documents** attest to Semitic slaves in Egypt and occasional rise to high positions (cf. Joseph). The **Ipuwer Papyrus** describes chaos in Egypt possibly related to plague narratives, though dating is disputed. **Absence of evidence** challenges include no archaeological confirmation of the Exodus or wilderness wandering, and debate over whether the patriarchs represent historical individuals, eponymous ancestors, or literary constructs. Scholars continue debating whether Genesis preserves historical memories embedded in legendary material or represents theological historiography with minimal historical core.

**Structure:** Genesis comprises 50 chapters organized around ten "toledoth" (generations) formulae, each introducing a new section with "These are the generations of..." This structure traces humanity from creation through God's chosen family to the twelve tribes of Israel in Egypt. **Part I: Primeval History (Chapters 1-11)** covers creation, fall, flood, and the Table of Nations, establishing universal context. **Part II: Patriarchal Narratives (Chapters 12-50)** focuses on Abraham (12-25), Isaac (25-26), Jacob (27-36), and Joseph (37-50). The book begins with God creating cosmos from chaos and ends with Joseph's body in a coffin in Egypt, setting up the need for Exodus. Literary genres include poetry (creation hymn, blessings), genealogies (Adam to Noah, Shem to Abraham, twelve tribes), narratives (patriarchal stories), and proto-law (covenant stipulations). The structure emphasizes divine election narrowing from all humanity (Adam) to one nation (Israel) destined to bless all nations, establishing the particular-universal tension that characterizes biblical theology. Each section builds on the previous, showing God's faithfulness to covenant promises despite human failure, culminating in Joseph's statement that what humans intend for evil, God uses for good (50:20), foreshadowing redemptive themes developed throughout Scripture.

### Genesis Chapter 1

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness
was
 upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
And God saw the light, that
it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which
were
 under the firmament from the waters which
were above the firmament: and it was so.
And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry
land appear: and it was so.
And God called the dry
land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that
it was good.
And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed,
and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed
is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
And the earth brought forth grass,
and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed
was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that
it was good.
And the evening and the morning were the third day.
And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night:
he made the stars also.
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that
it was good.
And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl
that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that
it was good.
And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that
it was good.
And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
So God created man in his
own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which
is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein
there is life,
I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold,
it was
 very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.


### Genesis Chapter 2

Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
These
are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and
there was not a man to till the ground.
But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
And the LORD God formed man
of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
The name of the first
is Pison: that
is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where
there is gold;
And the gold of that land
is good: there
is bdellium and the onyx stone.
And the name of the second river
is Gihon: the same
is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
And the name of the third river
is Hiddekel: that
is
 it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river
is Euphrates.
And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
And the LORD God said,
It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought
them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that
was the name thereof.
And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
And Adam said, This
is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.


### Genesis Chapter 3

Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
But of the fruit of the tree which
is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
And when the woman saw that the tree
was good for food, and that it
was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make
one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
art
 thou?
And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I
was naked; and I hid myself.
And he said, Who told thee that thou
wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest
to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
And the LORD God said unto the woman, What
is this
that
 thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou
art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire
shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed
is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat
of it all the days of thy life;
Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou
art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.


### Genesis Chapter 4

And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee
shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
And the LORD said unto Cain, Where
is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not:
Am I my brother’s keeper?
And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.
And now
art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;
When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment
is greater than I can bear.
Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass,
that every one that findeth me shall slay me.
And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one
was
 Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and
of such as have cattle.
And his brother’s name
was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain
was Naamah.
And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God,
said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.


### Genesis Chapter 5

And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:
And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:
And he called his name Noah, saying, This
same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.
And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:
And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.

### Genesis Chapter 6

And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they
were
 fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also
is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare
children
 to them, the same
became mighty men which
were
 of old, men of renown.
And GOD saw that the wickedness of man
was great in the earth, and
that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart
was
 only evil continually.
And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
These
are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man
and perfect in his generations,
and Noah walked with God.
And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
And this
is the fashion which thou shalt make it
of:
 The length of the ark
shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof;
with
 lower, second, and third
stories shalt thou make it.
And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein
is the breath of life, from under heaven;
and every thing that
is in the earth shall die.
But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.
And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every
sort
 shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep
them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every
sort shall come unto thee, to keep
them alive.
And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather
it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.


### Genesis Chapter 7

And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that
are not clean by two, the male and his female.
Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.
And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.
And Noah
was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
Of clean beasts, and of beasts that
are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,
There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.
And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;
They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein
is the breath of life.
And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.
And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.
And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that
were under the whole heaven, were covered.
Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
All in whose nostrils
was the breath of life, of all that
was in the dry
land, died.
And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained
alive, and they that
were with him in the ark.
And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.


### Genesis Chapter 8

And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that
was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;
The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth
month, on the first
day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:
And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters
were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth
was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first
month, the first
day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
And God spake unto Noah, saying,
Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.
Bring forth with thee every living thing that
is with thee, of all flesh,
both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:
Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl,
and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.
And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart
is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.


### Genesis Chapter 9

And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth
upon
 the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.
But flesh with the life thereof,
which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man.
Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.
And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
And with every living creature that
is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
And God said, This
is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that
is with you, for perpetual generations:
I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:
And I will remember my covenant, which
is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that
is upon the earth.
And God said unto Noah, This
is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that
is upon the earth.
And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
These
are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
And Noah began
to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid
it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces
were backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.
And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
And he said, Cursed
be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
And he said, Blessed
be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.


### Genesis Chapter 10

Now these
are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.
The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.
And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same
is a great city.
And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.
And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,
And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,
And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.
These
are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries,
and in their nations.
Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were
children born.
The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one
was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name
was
 Joktan.
And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazar-maveth, and Jerah,
And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these
were the sons of Joktan.
And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.
These
are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
These
are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.

### Genesis Chapter 11

And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.
And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top
may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
And the LORD said, Behold, the people
is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.
So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
These
are the generations of Shem: Shem
was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:
And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:
And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:
And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:
And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:
And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:
And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:
And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:
And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
Now these
are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.
And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife
was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
But Sarai was barren; she
had no child.
And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.


### Genesis Chapter 12

Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee:
And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram
was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite
was then in the land.
And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.
And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent,
having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.
And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine
was grievous in the land.
And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou
art a fair woman to look upon:
Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This
is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
Say, I pray thee, thou
art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she
was very fair.
The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.
And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What
is this
that
 thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she
was
 thy wife?
Why saidst thou, She
is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take
her, and go thy way.
And Pharaoh commanded
his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.


### Genesis Chapter 13

And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
And Abram
was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;
Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we
be brethren.
Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if
thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if
thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it
was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah,
even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.
Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched
his tent toward Sodom.
But the men of Sodom
were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.
And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth,
then shall thy seed also be numbered.
Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.
Then Abram removed
his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which
is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.


### Genesis Chapter 14

And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.
Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that
were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which
is
 by the wilderness.
And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which
is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites that dwelt in Hazezon-tamar.
And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same
is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
And the vale of Siddim
was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.
And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these
were confederate with Abram.
And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained
servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued
them unto Dan.
And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which
is on the left hand of Damascus.
And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that
were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which
is the king’s dale.
And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he
was the priest of the most high God.
And he blessed him, and said, Blessed
be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
That I will not
take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that
is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.


### Genesis Chapter 15

After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I
am thy shield,
and thy exceeding great reward.
And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
And, behold, the word of the LORD
came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
And he said unto him, I
am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.
And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land
that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites
is not yet full.
And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:
The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,
And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.

### Genesis Chapter 16

Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name
was Hagar.
And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong
be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.
But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid
is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.
And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.
And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou
art
 with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.
And he will be a wild man; his hand
will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?
Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold,
it is
 between Kadesh and Bered.
And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.
And Abram
was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.


### Genesis Chapter 17

And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I
am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
As for me, behold, my covenant
is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.
Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.
And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.
This
is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.
And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which
is not of thy seed.
He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah
shall her name
be.
And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be
a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.
Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall
a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!
And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant,
and with his seed after him.
And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
And Abraham
was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
And Ishmael his son
was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.


### Genesis Chapter 18

And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw
them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead
it, and make cakes upon the hearth.
And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave
it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set
it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
And they said unto him, Where
is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard
it
 in the tent door, which
was behind him.
Now Abraham and Sarah
were old
and well stricken in age;
and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?
Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;
Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that
are
 therein?
That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which
am but dust and ashes:
Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for
lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy
it.
And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do
it for forty’s sake.
And he said
unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do
it, if I find thirty there.
And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy
it for twenty’s sake.
And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy
it for ten’s sake.
And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.


### Genesis Chapter 19

And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing
them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
But before they lay down, the men of the city,
even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where
are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,
And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as
is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
And they said, Stand back. And they said
again, This one
fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,
even Lot, and came near to break the door.
But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
And they smote the men that
were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring
them out of this place:
For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.
And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:
Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:
And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father
is old, and
there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,
and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same
is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same
is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.


### Genesis Chapter 20

And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She
is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou
art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she
is a man’s wife.
But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?
Said he not unto me, She
is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He
is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.
And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
Now therefore restore the man
his wife; for he
is
 a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore
her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that
are thine.
Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.
Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God
is
 not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.
And yet indeed
she is my sister; she
is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This
is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He
is
 my brother.
And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave
them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
And Abimelech said, Behold, my land
is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.
And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand
pieces of silver: behold, he
is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that
are with thee, and with all
other:
 thus she was reproved.
So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare
children.
For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.

### Genesis Chapter 21

And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh,
so that all that hear will laugh with me.
And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born
him a son in his old age.
And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the
same day that Isaac was weaned.
And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son,
even
 with Isaac.
And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.
And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he
is thy seed.
And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave
it unto Hagar, putting
it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
And she went, and sat her down over against
him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against
him, and lift up her voice, and wept.
And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he
is.
Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God
is with thee in all that thou doest:
Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son:
but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
And Abraham said, I will swear.
And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.
And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I
of it, but to day.
And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What
mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
And he said, For
these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.
Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.
Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
And
Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.
And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.


### Genesis Chapter 22

And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold,
here I
am.
And he said, Take now thy son, thine only
son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you,
And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid
it
 upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here
am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where
is the lamb for a burnt offering?
And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here
am I.
And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only
son from me.
And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said
to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.
And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,
And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only
son:
That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which
is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.
And his concubine, whose name
was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.


### Genesis Chapter 23

And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old:
these were
 the years of the life of Sarah.
And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same
is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,
I
am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
Hear us, my lord: thou
art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land,
even to the children of Heth.
And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which
is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.
And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth,
even
 of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that
is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou
wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take
it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
My lord, hearken unto me: the land
is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what
is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current
money with the merchant.
And the field of Ephron, which
was in Machpelah, which
was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which
was therein, and all the trees that
were in the field, that
were
 in all the borders round about, were made sure
Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same
is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
And the field, and the cave that
is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.


### Genesis Chapter 24

And Abraham was old,
and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:
But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.
And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?
And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.
And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.
And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.
And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master
were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening,
even the time that women go out to draw
water.
And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.
Behold, I stand
here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:
And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also:
let the same be she
that
 thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.
And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
And the damsel
was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.
And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw
water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw
water, and drew for all his camels.
And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.
And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten
shekels weight of gold;
And said, Whose daughter
art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room
in thy father’s house for us to lodge in?
And she said unto him, I
am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.
She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.
And he said, Blessed
be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I
being
 in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master’s brethren.
And the damsel ran, and told
them of her mother’s house these things.
And Rebekah had a brother, and his name
was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.
And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men’s feet that
were with him.
And there was set
meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.
And he said, I
am Abraham’s servant.
And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.
And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.
And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.
And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:
Then shalt thou be clear from
this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee
one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go;
Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw
water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels:
let the same
be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master’s son.
And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew
water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her
shoulder,
 and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter
art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter unto his son.
And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
Behold, Rebekah
is before thee, take
her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.
And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD,
bowing himself to the earth.
And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave
them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
And they did eat and drink, he and the men that
were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us
a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.
And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.
And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou
art our sister, be thou
the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.
And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.
And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels
were coming.
And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
For she
had said unto the servant, What man
is
 this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant
had
 said, It
is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.
And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s
death.

### Genesis Chapter 25

Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name
was Keturah.
And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these
were the children of Keturah.
And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
And these
are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.
Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full
of years; and was gathered to his people.
And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which
is before Mamre;
The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.
Now these
are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:
And these
are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
These
are the sons of Ishmael, and these
are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
And these
are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that
is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria:
and he died in the presence of all his brethren.
And these
are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac:
And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she
was
 barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If
it be so, why
am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.
And the LORD said unto her, Two nations
are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and
the one
 people shall be stronger than
the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,
there were twins in her womb.
And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac
was threescore years old when she bare them.
And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob
was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of
his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he
was
 faint:
And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red
pottage; for I
am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
And Esau said, Behold, I
am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised
his birthright.

### Genesis Chapter 26

And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.
And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:
Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;
And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
And the men of the place asked
him of his wife; and he said, She
is my sister: for he feared to say,
She is my wife; lest,
said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she
was fair to look upon.
And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac
was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she
is
 thy wife: and how saidst thou, She
is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.
And Abimelech said, What
is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
And Abimelech charged all
his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.
And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.
For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.
And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water
is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I
am
 the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I
am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.
And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well.
Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us,
even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou
art now the blessed of the LORD.
And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city
is
 Beer-sheba unto this day.
And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:
Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

### Genesis Chapter 42

Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.
And the sons of Israel came to buy
corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
And Joseph
was the governor over the land,
and he
it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him
with their faces to the earth.
And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye
are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
We
are all one man’s sons; we
are true
men,
 thy servants are no spies.
And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
And they said, Thy servants
are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest
is this day with our father, and one
is not.
And Joseph said unto them, That
is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye
are spies:
Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether
there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye
are spies.
And he put them all together into ward three days.
And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;
for
 I fear God:
If ye
be true
men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:
But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
And they said one to another, We
are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.
And they knew not that Joseph understood
them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.
And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.
And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it
was in his sack’s mouth.
And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,
it is even in my sack: and their heart failed
them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What
is this
that
 God hath done unto us?
And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,
The man,
who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
And we said unto him, We
are true
men; we are no spies:
We
be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one
is
 not, and the youngest
is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye
are true
men; leave one of your brethren
here with me, and take
food for the famine of your households, and be gone:
And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye
are no spies, but
that ye
are true
men: so
 will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.
And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money
was in his sack: and when
both
 they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved
of my children: Joseph
is not, and Simeon
is not, and ye will take Benjamin
away: all these things are against me.
And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.


### Genesis Chapter 43

And the famine
was sore in the land.
And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother
be with you.
If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
But if thou wilt not send
him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother
be
 with you.
And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying,
Is your father yet alive? have ye
another
 brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou,
and
 also our little ones.
I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.
And their father Israel said unto them, If
it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry
it again in your hand; peradventure it
was an oversight:
Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved
of my children,
 I am bereaved.
And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring
these men home, and slay, and make ready; for
these men shall dine with me at noon.
And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.
And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,
every man’s money
was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
And he said, Peace
be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave
them
 water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
And he asked them of
their welfare, and said,
Is
 your father well, the old man of whom ye spake?
Is he yet alive?
And they answered, Thy servant our father
is in good health, he
is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.
And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said,
Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought
where to weep; and he entered into
his chamber, and wept there.
And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that
is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.
And he took
and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.


### Genesis Chapter 44

And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks
with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.
And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
And when they were gone out of the city,
and not
yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
Is not this
it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.
And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:
Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?
With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen.
And he said, Now also
let it
be according unto your words; he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.
Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
And he searched,
and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he
was
 yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
And Joseph said unto them, What deed
is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we
are my lord’s servants, both we, and
he also with whom the cup is found.
And he said, God forbid that I should do so:
but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.
Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou
art even as Pharaoh.
My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.
And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.
And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for
if he should leave his father,
his father would die.
And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
And our father said, Go again,
and buy us a little food.
And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother
be with us.
And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two
sons:
And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:
And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad
be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;
It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad
is not
with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.
For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.
Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad
be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.


### Genesis Chapter 45

Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
And Joseph said unto his brethren, I
am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I
am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
For these two years
hath the famine
been in the land: and yet
there are five years, in the which
there shall
 neither
be earing nor harvest.
And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
So now
it was not you
that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not:
And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children’s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:
And there will I nourish thee; for yet
there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.
And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that
it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.
And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.
And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt
is yours.
And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred
pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
And to his father he sent after this
manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.
So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.
And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father,
And told him, saying, Joseph
is yet alive, and he
is
 governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob’s heart fainted, for he believed them not.
And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
And Israel said,
It is enough; Joseph my son
is
 yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.

### Genesis Chapter 46

And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here
am I.
And he said, I
am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:
I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up
again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
And these
are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.
And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.
And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.
And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.
And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
These
be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters
were thirty and three.
And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.
These
are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob,
even sixteen souls.
The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.
And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him.
And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
These
are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls
were fourteen.
And the sons of Dan; Hushim.
And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
These
are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls
were seven.
All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls
were threescore and six;
And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt,
were
 two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt,
were threescore and ten.
And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou
art yet alive.
And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father’s house, which
were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
And the men
are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What
is your occupation?
That ye shall say, Thy servants’ trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we,
and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd
is an abomination unto the Egyptians.


### Genesis Chapter 47

Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they
are in the land of Goshen.
And he took some of his brethren,
even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What
is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants
are shepherds, both we,
and also our fathers.
They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine
is
 sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:
The land of Egypt
is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest
any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old
art thou?
And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage
are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to
their families.
And
there was no bread in all the land; for the famine
was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and
all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.
And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.
And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.
And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread
in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.
When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide
it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:
Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give
us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.
And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh’s.
And as for the people, he removed them to cities from
one
 end of the borders of Egypt even to the
other end thereof.
Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion
assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.
Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo,
here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth
part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.
And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,
that Pharaoh should have the fifth
part; except the land of the priests only,
which became not Pharaoh’s.
And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.
And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:
But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head.


### Genesis Chapter 48

And it came to pass after these things, that
one told Joseph, Behold, thy father
is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
And
one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee
for an everlasting possession.
And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt,
are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,
and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet
there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.
And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who
are these?
And Joseph said unto his father, They
are my sons, whom God hath given me in this
place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age,
so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.
And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought
them near unto him.
And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who
was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh
was the firstborn.
And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,
The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.
And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this
is
 the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.
And his father refused, and said, I know
it, my son, I know
it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.


### Genesis Chapter 49

And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you
that which shall befall you in the last days.
Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.
Reuben, thou
art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:
Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; then defiledst thou
it: he went up to my couch.
Simeon and Levi
are brethren; instruments of cruelty
are in their habitations.
O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.
Cursed
be their anger, for
it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
Judah, thou
art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand
shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee.
Judah
is a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?
The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him
shall the gathering of the people
be.
Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:
His eyes
shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he
shall be
 for an haven of ships; and his border
shall be unto Zidon.
Issachar
is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
And he saw that rest
was good, and the land that
it was
 pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.
Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.
I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.
Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.
Out of Asher his bread
shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.
Naphtali
is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
Joseph
is a fruitful bough,
even a fruitful bough by a well;
whose branches run over the wall:
The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot
at him, and hated him:
But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty
God of Jacob; (from thence
is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)
Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:
The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
Benjamin shall ravin
as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.
All these
are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this
is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that
is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
In the cave that
is in the field of Machpelah, which
is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.
There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
The purchase of the field and of the cave that
is therein
was from the children of Heth.
And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.


### Genesis Chapter 50

And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which
is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This
is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which
is
 beyond Jordan.
And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we
be thy servants.
And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for
am I in the place of God?
But as for you, ye thought evil against me;
but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as
it is this day, to save much people alive.
Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.
And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third
generation:
 the children also of Machir the son Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph’s knees.
And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
So Joseph died,
being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

## Part 2: Patriarchal Period

### Historical and Cultural Background: Patriarchal Period

**Historical Context (Abraham to Joseph (~2000-1500 BCE))**

The Patriarchal Period encompasses Genesis 12-50, narrating the stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph—the founding fathers of Israel. Traditional chronology places this period approximately 2000-1500 BCE, corresponding to the Middle Bronze Age II (MB II, 2000-1550 BCE) in Levantine archaeology. However, dating and historicity remain contested among scholars. Some date the patriarchs to MB II based on cultural parallels with Mari and Nuzi texts, while others question their historical existence entirely, viewing them as eponymous ancestors or literary constructs from later periods. Archaeological evidence provides indirect rather than direct confirmation: the **Mari Tablets** (18th century BCE) describe customs paralleling Genesis (adoption practices, inheritance laws, marriage customs), and **Nuzi documents** (15th century BCE) reflect similar social structures. Personal names similar to Abraham (Abamram), Jacob (Yaqub-El), and Joseph appear in ancient Near Eastern texts from various periods, though not referencing these specific individuals. The narrative describes seminomadic pastoralists moving between Mesopotamia, Canaan, and Egypt, consistent with Middle Bronze Age migration patterns evidenced archaeologically. However, anachronisms challenge early dating: references to Philistines (not present until 1200 BCE, Genesis 21:32), camels as domesticated beasts of burden (widespread only from 1200 BCE onward, though earlier limited use debated), and "Ur of the Chaldeans" (terminology from 1st millennium BCE). Critical scholarship often dates the final composition to the exilic or post-exilic period (6th-5th century BCE), seeing the patriarchal narratives as theological prehistory shaped by later Israel's self-understanding. Conservative scholars maintain the narratives preserve authentic historical memories from the 2nd millennium BCE, transmitted orally and later written during the Mosaic period or monarchy. The patriarchal promises (land, descendants, blessing) establish the covenantal framework central to biblical theology and Israel's national identity.

**Geographic Setting**

The Patriarchal narratives span a vast geographic range across the Fertile Crescent. Abraham's journey begins in **Ur of the Chaldeans** (southern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq), moves to **Haran** (northern Mesopotamia, modern Turkey-Syria border), then into **Canaan** (modern Israel/Palestine). Key Canaanite locations include **Shechem** (first stop, Genesis 12:6, site of Abraham's first altar), **Bethel** (where Abraham builds altars, Genesis 12:8, 13:3), **Hebron/Mamre** (Abraham's primary residence, Genesis 13:18, 18:1), and **Beer-sheba** (southern boundary, Genesis 21:31). Archaeological excavations confirm Middle Bronze Age occupation at these sites. Isaac remains primarily in southern Canaan (Beer-sheba, Gerar region), while Jacob's travels extend the geography: fleeing to **Haran** (repeating Abraham's route, Genesis 28-31), wrestling with God at the **Jabbok River** (Transjordan, Genesis 32), settling at **Shechem** and **Bethel** (Genesis 33-35). Joseph's narrative shifts to **Egypt**, specifically the Nile Delta region where Asiatic peoples (Hyksos) settled during the Second Intermediate Period (1650-1550 BCE). The **Goshen** region (Genesis 45:10, 47:6) likely corresponds to the eastern Nile Delta. Trade routes connected these regions: the **Via Maris** (coastal route from Egypt through Canaan to Mesopotamia) and the **King's Highway** (Transjordan route) facilitated movement and commerce. The patriarchs' seminomadic lifestyle moving between settlements fits Middle Bronze Age pastoral patterns, with seasonal movements between grazing lands and urban centers for trade and social interaction. Geographic realism in the narratives (accurate place names, routes, distances) suggests either authentic historical memory or later detailed geographical knowledge incorporated into the composition.

**Cultural Context**

The Patriarchal narratives reflect Middle Bronze Age Levantine and Mesopotamian cultural practices. Family structure centered on the **patriarchal household** (bet ab, "father's house"), an extended family unit including multiple generations, servants, and dependents (cf. Abraham's 318 trained men, Genesis 14:14). Marriage customs included **bride price** (mohar, Genesis 24:53), **levirate marriage** (brother marrying deceased brother's widow, prefigured in Tamar-Judah narrative, Genesis 38), and **concubinage** (secondary wives/slaves bearing children, as Hagar to Abraham, Bilhah and Zilpah to Jacob). Inheritance practices favored the firstborn receiving a **double portion** (contested in Isaac-Ishmael, Jacob-Esau, Joseph-brothers dynamics), though God consistently chooses the younger son, reversing cultural norms. **Adoption** practices appear similar to Nuzi customs (childless couples adopting servants as heirs until natural children arrive, cf. Eliezer, Genesis 15:2-3). **Hospitality** was sacred duty, as seen in Abraham hosting three visitors (Genesis 18) and Lot in Sodom (Genesis 19). **Naming practices** carried significance, with names often reflecting circumstances (Isaac="laughter," Jacob="heel-grabber/supplanter," Israel="struggles with God"). **Burial customs** involved purchasing burial sites (Abraham buying Machpelah cave, Genesis 23), with family tombs for generational burials. **Covenant ceremonies** included ritual animal sacrifice and passing between severed animals (Genesis 15:9-21), paralleling ancient Near Eastern treaty-making rituals. **Dietary practices** distinguished clean/unclean animals (pre-Mosaic, Genesis 7:2), and **circumcision** served as covenant sign (Genesis 17:10-14). **Shepherding** dominated occupational life, with seminomadic pastoralism the primary economic activity. **Household gods** (teraphim, Genesis 31:19) indicate popular religion beyond strict monotheism. Cultural conflicts appear: Canaanite-Israelite tensions over land and religion, and Egyptian-Asiatic distinctions (shepherds an abomination to Egyptians, Genesis 46:34).

**Political Context**

The Patriarchal Period corresponds to significant political developments in the ancient Near East. In **Mesopotamia**, the Old Babylonian Period (2000-1600 BCE) saw Hammurabi's empire (1792-1750 BCE) and the Mari kingdom's flourishing (evidenced by the Mari Archives). The **Amorite** migrations into Mesopotamia and Canaan during this period may relate to patriarchal movements, as Amorite (Western Semitic) names and cultural features align with the patriarchal narratives. In **Canaan**, Middle Bronze Age IIA (2000-1750 BCE) witnessed re-urbanization after Early Bronze Age collapse, with city-states emerging at Hazor, Shechem, and other sites mentioned in Genesis. Political organization was decentralized city-states (as Genesis 14's coalition of Canaanite kings suggests), each controlling surrounding agricultural land. In **Egypt**, the Middle Kingdom (2055-1650 BCE) gave way to the Second Intermediate Period (1650-1550 BCE) when Asiatic **Hyksos** rulers controlled the Nile Delta, possibly correlating with Joseph's rise to power under a Semitic-friendly administration. The absence of pharaonic names in Genesis creates chronological ambiguity, though Joseph's administrative role (collecting grain, Genesis 41:46-57) parallels Egyptian viziers' functions. The patriarchs operate outside formal political structures, existing as **seminomadic pastoralists** negotiating with local rulers (Abraham with Abimelech of Gerar, Genesis 20-21; Jacob with Shechem's rulers, Genesis 34). Divine promises supersede human political authority, with God granting land irrespective of current political realities. Treaties and covenants appear: Abraham's covenant with Abimelech (Genesis 21:22-32), anticipating later Israel's diplomatic relations. The Joseph narrative introduces the patriarchs to **imperial politics**, with Joseph navigating Egyptian court intrigue and wielding centralized administrative power. This transition foreshadows Israel's eventual engagement with imperial politics (Egyptian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian).

**Economic Context**

The patriarchal economy centers on **pastoral nomadism** combined with settled agriculture and trade. The patriarchs' wealth consisted primarily of **livestock** (sheep, goats, cattle, donkeys, camels—though camel domestication timing is debated), **servants** (economic assets and workforce), **silver and gold** (Abraham "very rich in livestock, silver, and gold," Genesis 13:2), and **land rights** (wells, burial plots, grazing agreements). Economic activities included **shepherding** (moving flocks seasonally between grazing lands), **trade** (Abraham's silver for purchasing Machpelah, Genesis 23; Joseph's grain administration, Genesis 41), **agriculture** (Isaac planting crops and reaping hundredfold, Genesis 26:12), and **treaty-making** for economic security (well rights, Genesis 21:25-32). Major **trade routes** traversed patriarchal territories: the Via Maris (coastal route) and King's Highway (Transjordan route) connected Egypt, Canaan, and Mesopotamia, facilitating commerce in luxury goods (spices, incense, myrrh brought by Ishmaelites/Midianites, Genesis 37:25). The patriarchs engaged in **reciprocal gift exchange** (Abraham to Pharaoh, Genesis 12:16; Jacob to Esau, Genesis 33:10-11) typical of patron-client relationships in ancient Near Eastern economics. **Market economies** appear in urban centers where patriarchs traded (purchasing grain in Egypt, Genesis 42-47; buying land at Shechem, Genesis 33:19), while **subsistence pastoralism** characterized their primary lifestyle. The **famine narratives** (Abraham in Egypt, Genesis 12:10; Isaac in Gerar, Genesis 26:1; Jacob's family in Egypt, Genesis 41-47) reflect Middle Bronze Age climate fluctuations evidenced archaeologically. Joseph's economic administration in Egypt (Genesis 41:46-57, 47:13-26) describes centralized storage, price controls, and land nationalization, paralleling Egyptian economic systems under strong pharaohs. Wealth transfer occurs through **inheritance** (contested in Genesis through younger son patterns) and **blessing** (material prosperity tied to divine favor). Economic partnerships appear: Abraham and Lot's separation due to resource competition (Genesis 13:5-12), and later business arrangements with local rulers. The patriarchal economy thus blends nomadic pastoralism with participation in settled agricultural and urban commercial networks, positioned at the intersection of ancient Near Eastern trade routes.

**Religious Context**

Patriarchal religion represents a transitional phase between ancient Near Eastern polytheism and Israelite monotheism. God reveals Himself through various names: **El Shaddai** ("God Almighty," Genesis 17:1), **El Elyon** ("God Most High," Genesis 14:18-22), **El Roi** ("God Who Sees," Genesis 16:13), **El Olam** ("Everlasting God," Genesis 21:33), and **Yahweh** (the divine name, though Exodus 6:3 suggests full revelation awaited Moses). The **"God of the fathers" formula** (God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) emphasizes personal covenant relationship rather than territorial deity. Worship practices are informal: **altars** built at significant locations (Shechem, Bethel, Hebron, Beer-sheba, Genesis 12:7-8, 13:18, 21:33), **sacrifices** offered personally without priestly mediation (Genesis 22:13, 31:54), **pillars** (masseboth) erected to commemorate divine encounters (Genesis 28:18, 31:45, 35:14), and **prayer** directly to God (Abraham interceding for Sodom, Genesis 18:22-33; Isaac for Rebekah's fertility, Genesis 25:21). **Circumcision** serves as covenant sign (Genesis 17:9-14), marking physical and theological distinctiveness. **Dreams and visions** mediate divine communication (Jacob's ladder, Genesis 28:12; Joseph's dreams, Genesis 37). **Theophany** (divine appearance) occurs in human-like form (three men visiting Abraham, Genesis 18; wrestling with Jacob, Genesis 32:24-30). **Covenant** emerges as the central religious structure: Abrahamic covenant promising land, descendants, and blessing (Genesis 12:1-3, 15:1-21, 17:1-27). Religious syncretism appears: Rachel stealing household gods (Genesis 31:19), suggesting popular religion retained polytheistic elements; Tamar at Enaim shrine-prostitution (Genesis 38:14-22), indicating Canaanite fertility cult participation. **Sacrifice theology** develops: Isaac's near-sacrifice (Akedah, Genesis 22) establishes substitutionary atonement principles. **Blessing and curse** hold magical-like power (Isaac blessing Jacob irreversibly, Genesis 27). **Monotheistic tendency** emerges: Abraham refusing gifts from Sodom's king "lest you say, 'I have made Abram rich'" (Genesis 14:23), attributing all to Yahweh alone. The patriarchal religion thus represents henotheism (worshiping one God while acknowledging others' existence) transitioning toward ethical monotheism (Yahweh alone is God, all others are false). This religious development establishes foundations for Mosaic covenant, Torah, temple cult, and prophetic theology.

### Genesis Chapter 1

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness
was
 upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
And God saw the light, that
it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which
were
 under the firmament from the waters which
were above the firmament: and it was so.
And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry
land appear: and it was so.
And God called the dry
land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that
it was good.
And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed,
and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed
is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
And the earth brought forth grass,
and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed
was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that
it was good.
And the evening and the morning were the third day.
And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night:
he made the stars also.
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that
it was good.
And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl
that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that
it was good.
And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that
it was good.
And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
So God created man in his
own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which
is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein
there is life,
I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold,
it was
 very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.


### Genesis Chapter 2

Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
These
are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and
there was not a man to till the ground.
But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
And the LORD God formed man
of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
The name of the first
is Pison: that
is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where
there is gold;
And the gold of that land
is good: there
is bdellium and the onyx stone.
And the name of the second river
is Gihon: the same
is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
And the name of the third river
is Hiddekel: that
is
 it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river
is Euphrates.
And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
And the LORD God said,
It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought
them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that
was the name thereof.
And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
And Adam said, This
is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.


### Genesis Chapter 3

Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
But of the fruit of the tree which
is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
And when the woman saw that the tree
was good for food, and that it
was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make
one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
art
 thou?
And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I
was naked; and I hid myself.
And he said, Who told thee that thou
wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest
to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
And the LORD God said unto the woman, What
is this
that
 thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou
art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire
shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed
is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat
of it all the days of thy life;
Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou
art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.
And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.


### Genesis Chapter 4

And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.
And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee
shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
And the LORD said unto Cain, Where
is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not:
Am I my brother’s keeper?
And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.
And now
art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;
When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment
is greater than I can bear.
Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass,
that every one that findeth me shall slay me.
And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one
was
 Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and
of such as have cattle.
And his brother’s name
was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain
was Naamah.
And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God,
said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.


### Genesis Chapter 5

### Genesis Chapter 6

And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they
were
 fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also
is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare
children
 to them, the same
became mighty men which
were
 of old, men of renown.
And GOD saw that the wickedness of man
was great in the earth, and
that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart
was
 only evil continually.
And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
These
are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man
and perfect in his generations,
and Noah walked with God.
And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
And this
is the fashion which thou shalt make it
of:
 The length of the ark
shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof;
with
 lower, second, and third
stories shalt thou make it.
And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein
is the breath of life, from under heaven;
and every thing that
is in the earth shall die.
But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.
And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every
sort
 shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep
them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every
sort shall come unto thee, to keep
them alive.
And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather
it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.

And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold,

And he said, Take now thy son, thine only
son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you,
And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid
it
 upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here
am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where
is the lamb for a burnt offering?
And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here
am I.
And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only
son from me.
And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said
to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.
And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,
And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only
son:
That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which
is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.
And his concubine, whose name
was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.


### Genesis Chapter 23

And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old:
these were
 the years of the life of Sarah.
And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same
is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,
I
am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
Hear us, my lord: thou
art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land,
even to the children of Heth.
And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which
is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.
And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth,
even
 of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that
is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou
wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take
it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
My lord, hearken unto me: the land
is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what
is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current
money with the merchant.
And the field of Ephron, which
was in Machpelah, which
was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which
was therein, and all the trees that
were in the field, that
were
 in all the borders round about, were made sure
Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same
is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
And the field, and the cave that
is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.


### Genesis Chapter 24

And Abraham was old,
and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:
But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.
And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?
And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.
And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.
And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.
And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master
were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening,
even the time that women go out to draw
water.
And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.
Behold, I stand
here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:
And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also:
let the same be she
that
 thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.
And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
And the damsel
was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.
And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw
water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw
water, and drew for all his camels.
And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.
And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten
shekels weight of gold;
And said, Whose daughter
art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room
in thy father’s house for us to lodge in?
And she said unto him, I
am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.
She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.
And he said, Blessed
be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I
being
 in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master’s brethren.
And the damsel ran, and told
them of her mother’s house these things.
And Rebekah had a brother, and his name
was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.
And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men’s feet that
were with him.
And there was set
meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.
And he said, I
am Abraham’s servant.
And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.
And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.
And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.
And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:
Then shalt thou be clear from
this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee
one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go;
Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw
water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels:
let the same
be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master’s son.
And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew
water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her
shoulder,
 and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter
art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter unto his son.
And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
Behold, Rebekah
is before thee, take
her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.
And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD,
bowing himself to the earth.
And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave
them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
And they did eat and drink, he and the men that
were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us
a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.
And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.
And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou
art our sister, be thou
the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.
And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.
And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels
were coming.
And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
For she
had said unto the servant, What man
is
 this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant
had
 said, It
is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.
And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s
death.

### Genesis Chapter 25

Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name
was Keturah.
And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these
were the children of Keturah.
And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
And these
are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.
Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full
of years; and was gathered to his people.
And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which
is before Mamre;
The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.
Now these
are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:
And these
are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
These
are the sons of Ishmael, and these
are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
And these
are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that
is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria:
and he died in the presence of all his brethren.
And these
are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac:
And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she
was
 barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If
it be so, why
am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.
And the LORD said unto her, Two nations
are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and
the one
 people shall be stronger than
the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,
there were twins in her womb.
And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac
was threescore years old when she bare them.
And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob
was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of
his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he
was
 faint:
And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red
pottage; for I
am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
And Esau said, Behold, I
am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised
his birthright.

### Genesis Chapter 26

And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.
And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:
Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;
And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
And the men of the place asked
him of his wife; and he said, She
is my sister: for he feared to say,
She is my wife; lest,
said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she
was fair to look upon.
And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac
was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she
is
 thy wife: and how saidst thou, She
is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.
And Abimelech said, What
is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
And Abimelech charged all
his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.
And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.
For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.
And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water
is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I
am
 the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I
am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.
And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well.
Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us,
even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou
art now the blessed of the LORD.
And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city
is
 Beer-sheba unto this day.
And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:
Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.


### Genesis Chapter 27

And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,
here am I.
And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:
Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me
some venison;
And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring
it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.
And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt
for venison,
and to bring
it.
And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,
Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:
And thou shalt bring
it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.
And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother
is a hairy man, and I
am a smooth man:
My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
And his mother said unto him, Upon me
be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me
them.
And he went, and fetched, and brought
them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.
And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which
were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:
And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:
And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here
am I; who
art thou, my son?
And Jacob said unto his father, I
am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
And Isaac said unto his son, How
is it that thou hast found
it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought
it to me.
And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou
be my very son Esau or not.
And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice
is Jacob’s voice, but the hands
are the hands of Esau.
And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.
And he said,
Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I
am.
And he said, Bring
it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought
it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.
And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son
is
 as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:
Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:
Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed
be
 every one that curseth thee, and blessed
be he that blesseth thee.
And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.
And Isaac his father said unto him, Who
art thou? And he said, I
am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.
And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where
is
 he that hath taken venison, and brought
it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea,
and
 he shall be blessed.
And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,
even
 me also, O my father.
And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.
And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?
And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me,
even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;
And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself,
purposing to kill thee.
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn away;
Until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget
that
 which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?
And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these
which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?


### Genesis Chapter 28

And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother.
And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;
And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.
And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.
When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;
And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.
And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and
put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I
am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;
And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
And, behold, I
am with thee, and will keep thee in all
places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done
that which I have spoken to thee of.
And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew
it not.
And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful
is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this
is the gate of heaven.
And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put
for his pillows, and set it up
for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city
was called Luz at the first.
And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:
And this stone, which I have set
for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.


### Genesis Chapter 29

Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.
And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there
were
 three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone
was upon the well’s mouth.
And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well’s mouth in his place.
And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence
be ye? And they said, Of Haran
are we.
And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know
him.
And he said unto them,
Is he well? And they said,
He is
 well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
And he said, Lo,
it is yet high day, neither
is it
 time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go
and feed
them.
And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and
till they roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.
And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep: for she kept them.
And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.
And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
And Jacob told Rachel that he
was her father’s brother, and that he
was Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father.
And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
And Laban said to him, Surely thou
art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou
art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what
shall
 thy wages
be?
And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder
was Leah, and the name of the younger
was Rachel.
Leah
was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
And Laban said,
It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him
but a few days, for the love he had to her.
And Jacob said unto Laban, Give
me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.
And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid
for
 an handmaid.
And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it
was
 Leah: and he said to Laban, What
is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.
And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.
And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
And when the LORD saw that Leah
was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel
was barren.
And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I
was hated, he hath therefore given me this
son
 also: and she called his name Simeon.
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.
And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.


### Genesis Chapter 30

And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.
And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said,
Am
 I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees that I may also have children by her.
And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.
And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.
And Bilhah Rachel’s maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.
And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.
When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.
And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a son.
And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.
And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a second son.
And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.
And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.
And she said unto her,
Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son’s mandrakes.
And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.
And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.
And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.
And Leah said, God hath endued me
with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.
And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:
And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.
And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.
Give
me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.
And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes,
tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.
And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give
it.
And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.
For
it was little which thou hadst before I
came,
 and it is
now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?
And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed
and
 keep thy flock:
I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and
of such shall be my hire.
So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that
is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.
And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,
and every one that had
some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave
them into the hand of his sons.
And he set three days journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.
And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which
was in the rods.
And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.
And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban’s cattle.
And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
But when the cattle were feeble, he put
them not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.
And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

### Genesis Chapter 31

And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that
was our father’s; and of
that which
was
 our father’s hath he gotten all this glory.
And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it
was
 not toward him as before.
And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
And said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it
is
 not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.
And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.
Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given
them
 to me.
And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle
were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.
And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream,
saying, Jacob: And I said, Here
am I.
And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle
are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
I
am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar,
and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.
And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him,
Is there
 yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?
Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.
For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that
is ours, and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.
Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.
And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that
were her father’s.
And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face
toward the mount Gilead.
And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.
And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives
taken
 with the sword?
Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
And now,
though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father’s house,
yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what
is thine with me, and take
it
 to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents; but he found
them not. Then went he out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.
Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found
them
 not.
And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.
And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What
is my trespass? what
is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set
it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.
This twenty years
have I
been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
That which was torn
of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it,
whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.
Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.
Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked
thee yesternight.
And Laban answered and said unto Jacob,
These daughters
are my daughters, and
these children
are my children, and
these cattle
are my cattle, and all that thou seest
is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?
Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
And Jacob took a stone, and set it up
for a pillar.
And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.
And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
And Laban said, This heap
is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;
And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take
other
 wives beside my daughters, no man
is with us; see, God
is witness betwixt me and thee.
And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold
this
 pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;
This heap
be witness, and
this pillar
be
 witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.
Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.


### Genesis Chapter 32

And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
And when Jacob saw them, he said, This
is God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:
And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that
was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;
And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:
I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.
Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,
and the mother with the children.
And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;
Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,
Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.
And he delivered
them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose
art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose
are these before thee?
Then thou shalt say,
They be thy servant Jacob’s; it
is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he
is behind us.
And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.
And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob
is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.
So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.
And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.
And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
And he said unto him, What
is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
And Jacob asked
him, and said, Tell
me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore
is it
that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
Therefore the children of Israel eat not
of the sinew which shrank, which
is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.


### Genesis Chapter 33

And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.
And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who
are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.
Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
And he said, What
meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said,
These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.
And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.
And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took
it.
And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children
are
 tender, and the flocks and herds with young
are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.
Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee
some of the folk that
are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which
is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city.
And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for an hundred pieces of money.
And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.


### Genesis Chapter 34

And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.
And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.
And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come.
And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard
it:
 and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.
And make ye marriages with us,
and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:
And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that
were a reproach unto us:
But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we
be,
 that every male of you be circumcised;
Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son.
And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he
was more honourable than all the house of his father.
And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
These men
are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold,
it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they
are circumcised.
Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs
be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.
And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out.
The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister.
They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which
was in the city, and that which
was in the field,
And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that
was in the house.
And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I
being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?


### Genesis Chapter 35

And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that
were with him, Put away the strange gods that
are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:
And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which
were in their hand, and
all their earrings which
were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which
was by Shechem.
And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that
were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
So Jacob came to Luz, which
is in the land of Canaan, that
is, Bethel, he and all the people that
were with him.
And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth.
And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padan-aram, and blessed him.
And God said unto him, Thy name
is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.
And God said unto him, I
am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,
even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.
And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.
And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.
And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.
And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.
And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which
is
 Bethlehem.
And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that
is the pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day.
And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.
And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard
it.
 Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:
The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:
And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:
And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these
are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padan-aram.
And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which
is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.
And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people,
being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.

## Part 3: Exodus and Wilderness

### Historical and Cultural Background: Exodus and Wilderness

**Historical Context (Egyptian Bondage to Sinai (~1500-1400 BCE))**

The Exodus and Wilderness period encompasses Israel's enslavement in Egypt, liberation under Moses, covenant-making at Sinai, and forty years of wilderness wandering before entering Canaan. Dating remains the most contentious issue in biblical archaeology. The **early dating** places the Exodus around 1446 BCE (based on 1 Kings 6:1's "480 years" before Solomon's temple, c. 966 BCE), corresponding to Egypt's 18th Dynasty under Thutmose III or Amenhotep II. The **late dating** places it around 1290-1250 BCE during the 19th Dynasty under Ramesses II or his son Merneptah, supported by archaeological evidence of Late Bronze Age destructions in Canaan and the Merneptah Stele (1208 BCE) mentioning "Israel" as an established people in Canaan. Archaeological challenges abound: no Egyptian records explicitly describe the Exodus (though absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, as Egypt rarely recorded defeats), no physical evidence of 600,000+ Israelite men (Exodus 12:37, implying 2+ million total) in the Sinai, and debates over conquest vs. gradual settlement models in Canaan. The **Merneptah Stele** provides the earliest extra-biblical reference to "Israel" as a people (not city-state) in Canaan by 1208 BCE, establishing a terminus ante quem. Egyptian evidence includes: **Semitic slaves in Egypt** (documented in various periods), **Asiatic place names in the Delta** (possibly biblical sites), **Pharaonic building projects** using slave labor (Ramesses II's extensive construction matching Exodus's Pithom and Rameses, Exodus 1:11), and **evidence of Asiatic populations** in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period (Hyksos) and New Kingdom. Alternative theories include: **smaller exodus** (not literal 2+ million), **multiple exoduses** over centuries, **conquest as internal revolt** (Mendenhall/Gottwald peasant revolt model), or **gradual infiltration** rather than military conquest. Conservative scholars maintain historical reliability of Exodus account while acknowledging chronological ambiguities; critical scholars view it as foundational myth with possible historical kernels, shaped by later theological and political needs. The Sinai covenant and legal traditions likely reflect genuine historical memory, even if details resist archaeological verification.

**Geographic Setting**

The Exodus narrative spans Egypt, the Sinai Peninsula, and approaches to Canaan. In **Egypt**, the Israelites lived in **Goshen** (eastern Nile Delta, Genesis 47:6), likely the **Wadi Tumilat** region. They built **Pithom** (Tell el-Maskhuta or Tell er-Retabeh) and **Rameses** (Pi-Ramesse, Qantir), store cities for Pharaoh (Exodus 1:11). The exodus route remains debated: the **northern route** (Via Maris coastal road) was avoided due to Egyptian fortresses (Exodus 13:17); the **central route** crosses central Sinai; the **southern route** (traditional) goes to southern Sinai's Jebel Musa (traditional Mt. Sinai). The **Red Sea** crossing (Hebrew yam suph, "Sea of Reeds") location is disputed: **Gulf of Suez**, **Gulf of Aqaba**, **Bitter Lakes**, or **Lake Sirbonis/Bardawil** (northern marshlands). After crossing, Israel camped at various wilderness locations: **Marah** (bitter water made sweet), **Elim** (twelve springs), **Sin wilderness**, **Rephidim** (water from rock), and finally **Sinai/Horeb** for covenant-making. The **Sinai Peninsula** is a harsh desert environment with limited water and vegetation, explaining Israel's complaints and dependence on divine provision (manna, quail, water from rock). Traditional **Mt. Sinai** (Jebel Musa) in southern Sinai has ancient monastery tradition (St. Catherine's, 6th century CE), but other candidates include **Jebel Helal** (northern Sinai), **Mt. Seir** (Edom/Transjordan, based on some biblical texts), or even locations in **northwest Arabia** (based on Galatians 4:25). From Sinai, Israel traveled to **Kadesh-barnea** (northern Sinai/southern Negev oasis), the staging point for Canaan entry and later the wilderness wandering base. The forty-year wandering occurred in the **wilderness of Paran/Zin**, harsh desert regions south of Canaan.

**Cultural Context**

The cultural world of Exodus-Deuteronomy reflects Late Bronze Age Near Eastern civilization filtered through Israelite experience and later theological reflection. **Slavery in Egypt** was documented practice; the **Leiden Papyrus 348** describes grain quotas for workers including "Apiru" (possibly related to "Hebrew"), and numerous texts mention Semitic slaves. **Brick-making** (Exodus 5:7-19) aligns with Egyptian construction methods; murals depict brick-making processes matching biblical descriptions. **Circumcision** was practiced in Egypt (contrary to later Israelite distinctiveness claims, though perhaps not universally), evidenced by mummies and reliefs. **Midwifery** (Exodus 1:15-22) reflects ancient Near Eastern birthing practices. The **extended family/tribal structure** continued from patriarchal period, organized by tribes, clans, and households. **Priesthood** emerged with Aaron and Levites designated for sacred service, establishing hereditary priestly caste. **Dietary laws** (Leviticus 11) distinguished clean/unclean animals, separating Israel from surrounding peoples. **Sabbath** observance (Exodus 20:8-11) structured weekly rhythm unknown in ancient Near East (though seven-day week existed in Mesopotamia). **Festival calendar** (Passover, Unleavened Bread, Weeks, Tabernacles) tied worship to agricultural cycles and historical commemorations. **Tent dwelling** in the wilderness continued seminomadic lifestyle, though this was necessity rather than choice. The **Tabernacle** structure reflected ancient Near Eastern tent-shrine traditions, with layout paralleling Egyptian shrines and later Solomon's temple proportions. **Legal codes** (Covenant Code Exodus 20-23, Holiness Code Leviticus 17-26) paralleled other ancient Near Eastern law collections (Code of Hammurabi, Hittite Laws) while distinctively emphasizing covenant relationship and theocratic authority. **Marriage** and **family laws** regulated sexual morality, property rights, and social stability. **Warfare** practices included herem (divine ban requiring total destruction, Deuteronomy 7:2), reflecting ancient Near Eastern holy war ideology. The **Year of Jubilee** and **Sabbath Year** (Leviticus 25) provided economic resets unusual in ancient world.

**Political Context**

The political landscape during the Exodus period was dominated by **Egypt's New Kingdom** (1550-1077 BCE), particularly the 18th-19th Dynasties. If early dating (1446 BCE), the exodus occurred under **18th Dynasty** pharaohs like Thutmose III (1479-1425 BCE) or Amenhotep II (1427-1400 BCE), during Egypt's imperial zenith controlling Canaan and Syria. If late dating (1290-1250 BCE), **19th Dynasty** under Ramesses II (1279-1213 BCE) fits, with his extensive building projects (matching Pithom/Rameses) and military campaigns in Canaan. Egypt controlled Canaan through **city-state vassals**, evidenced by Amarna Letters (14th century BCE) showing Canaanite kings corresponding with Egyptian pharaohs. The **Merneptah Stele** (1208 BCE) demonstrates Egypt's continued Canaan presence, mentioning military action against "Israel" among other Canaanite entities. **Hittite Empire** (1600-1178 BCE) in Anatolia rivaled Egypt, with conflicts over Syria/Canaan (Battle of Kadesh, 1274 BCE, between Ramesses II and Hittite Muwatalli II). Political organization in the wilderness was **tribal confederation** under Moses's charismatic leadership, with seventy elders assisting governance (Exodus 18:13-27, following Jethro's advice). Military leadership emerged with Joshua. **Theocracy** was the ideal: Yahweh as true king, Moses as prophet-mediator, laws deriving from divine authority rather than human kingship. This contrasted with surrounding monarchies and anticipated later Israel's struggles with kingship (1 Samuel 8). The covenant at Sinai established **suzerainty treaty** structure (preamble, historical prologue, stipulations, witnesses, blessings/curses) paralleling Hittite vassal treaties, positioning Israel as Yahweh's covenant people rather than subjects of earthly empire.

**Economic Context**

The wilderness economy was **subsistence-based** with divine provision as theological emphasis. In Egypt, Israelites engaged in **forced labor** (corvée) on Pharaoh's building projects (Exodus 1:11-14), producing bricks, working fields, and performing hard service. This economic oppression motivated exodus. Upon leaving, Israelites "plundered" Egypt (Exodus 12:35-36), receiving silver, gold, and clothing, establishing initial wealth. The wilderness period required **divine provision**: **manna** (bread-like substance appearing daily except Sabbath, Exodus 16) and **quail** (migrating birds, Numbers 11:31-32) provided food, while **water from rock** miracles supplied drink (Exodus 17:6, Numbers 20:11). **Pastoralism** continued with flocks and herds brought from Egypt (Exodus 12:38). Economic organization included **tribute/taxation** for Tabernacle construction (Exodus 25:1-9, voluntary offerings of gold, silver, bronze, fabrics) and later the **half-shekel temple tax** (Exodus 30:11-16). **Spoils of war** (Midianite campaign, Numbers 31) were divided between warriors and congregation, with portions for Levites and priests. **Trade** was limited in wilderness but occurred at oases and with neighboring peoples (buying food and water from Edom, Deuteronomy 2:6). **Tithing** system (Leviticus 27, Numbers 18) established economic support for Levites who received no land inheritance. **Land redistribution** principles (Jubilee year, Leviticus 25) prevented permanent economic inequality, returning land to original families every fifty years. **Slavery** was regulated (Exodus 21, Deuteronomy 15) with debt slavery limited to seven years and release mandated. **Gleaning rights** (Leviticus 19:9-10) protected the poor, widows, and foreigners. The economic vision was **egalitarian** within covenant community while maintaining distinctions (priests, Levites, tribes, families), contrasting with hierarchical Near Eastern economies. The **promised land** (Canaan) represented economic hope: "land flowing with milk and honey" (Exodus 3:8) promised agricultural prosperity after wilderness hardship.

**Religious Context**

The Exodus-Wilderness period revolutionized Israelite religion, transitioning from patriarchal household worship to national covenant community with formalized cult. **Yahweh** (the divine name revealed to Moses, Exodus 3:14-15) became Israel's covenant God, distinguished from Egyptian and Canaanite deities. The **Ten Plagues** demonstrated Yahweh's supremacy over Egyptian gods (Nile, sun, fertility, etc.), establishing monotheistic claim. The **Passover** (Exodus 12) became foundational festival commemorating deliverance, with sacrificial lamb's blood protecting from death. The **Red Sea crossing** (Exodus 14) served as creation/salvation paradigm: Yahweh defeating chaos (sea), saving his people, destroying enemies. **Mt. Sinai covenant** (Exodus 19-24) established Israel as Yahweh's "treasured possession," "kingdom of priests," and "holy nation" (Exodus 19:5-6) through binding agreement. The **Decalogue** (Ten Commandments, Exodus 20, Deuteronomy 5) provided covenant stipulations, beginning with exclusive worship ("no other gods," Exodus 20:3) and prohibiting idolatry. The **Covenant Code** (Exodus 20:22-23:33) detailed case laws applying covenant principles. The **Golden Calf incident** (Exodus 32) revealed Israel's struggle against idolatry, nearly resulting in covenant annulment. The **Tabernacle** (Exodus 25-40) established Yahweh's dwelling among his people, with detailed specifications for tent-shrine, furnishings (ark, table, lampstand, altar, laver), and priestly vestments. **Sacrificial system** (Leviticus 1-7) included burnt offerings, grain offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings, managing holiness and atonement. **Day of Atonement** (Yom Kippur, Leviticus 16) annually cleansed sanctuary and people from sin through scapegoat ritual. **Levitical priesthood** (Aaron's sons) mediated between God and people, with Levites assisting. **Holiness Code** (Leviticus 17-26) demanded moral and ritual purity: "Be holy, for I am holy" (Leviticus 19:2). **Deuteronomy** presented covenant renewal, centralizing worship at chosen place (anticipating Jerusalem temple), emphasizing love for Yahweh (Shema, Deuteronomy 6:4-9), and warning against Canaanite religion. Theological themes included: **divine election** (choosing Israel), **covenant faithfulness**, **holiness**, **atonement through blood**, **mediation** (Moses, priests), and **divine presence** (glory cloud, Exodus 40:34-38). This religious system distinguished Israel from polytheistic neighbors while incorporating transformed ancient Near Eastern cultic elements (sacrifices, priesthood, festivals).

## Exodus

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Exodus describes events traditionally dated to the 15th or 13th century BCE, depending on whether one accepts the early dating (1446 BCE, based on 1 Kings 6:1) or late dating (1290-1250 BCE, based on archaeological evidence of Ramesses II's building projects and the Merneptah Stele). The composition date is likewise debated: traditional scholarship attributes it to Moses (15th-13th century BCE), writing during or shortly after the exodus events. The Documentary Hypothesis proposes multiple sources (J, E, P) composed between 10th-5th centuries BCE, with the Priestly source being latest and giving final shape to Exodus. Conservative scholars maintain substantial Mosaic authorship with possible later editorial updates, while critical scholars see it as theological history composed centuries after purported events, reflecting later Israel's self-understanding. The narrative spans approximately 80 years (from Moses's birth to the Tabernacle's completion), though exact chronology remains uncertain.

**Author and Audience:** Traditional authorship attributes Exodus to Moses, based on explicit statements (Exodus 17:14, 24:4, 34:27), ancient Jewish tradition, and New Testament references (Mark 7:10, Luke 2:22-23). Moses, educated in Egyptian court (Acts 7:22) and familiar with Midianite wilderness (Exodus 2-3), possessed requisite knowledge to compose the account. Critical scholarship challenges Mosaic authorship, citing: anachronisms (references to Philistines, Exodus 13:17, before their 12th century BCE arrival), Deuteronomic phraseology suggesting later editing, and apparent knowledge of post-Mosaic events. The Documentary Hypothesis identifies distinct sources: Yahwist (J, using divine name Yahweh), Elohist (E, using Elohim), and Priestly (P, emphasizing ritual and genealogy). Many scholars see Priestly editors giving Exodus final form during or after Babylonian exile (6th century BCE), addressing questions of identity, covenant, and worship for displaced Israel. The intended audience, whether wilderness-generation Israelites (traditional view) or exilic/post-exilic community (critical view), needed to understand their covenant identity, worship practices, and divine deliverance as foundational to being God's people. Both perspectives agree Exodus answers: Who are we? What makes us distinct? How should we worship? Why did God choose us?

**Key Themes:** Exodus develops crucial theological themes foundational to biblical faith. **Deliverance/Redemption:** God liberates his oppressed people from slavery (Exodus 1-15), establishing the exodus as paradigmatic salvation event referenced throughout Scripture. **Divine Power:** The ten plagues demonstrate Yahweh's supremacy over Egyptian gods and nature, validating monotheistic claims. **Covenant:** The Sinai covenant (Exodus 19-24) binds God and Israel in exclusive relationship, mediated through law and sacrifice. **Law/Torah:** The Decalogue (Exodus 20) and Covenant Code (Exodus 21-23) provide covenant stipulations, mixing absolute commands with case laws, establishing justice and holiness standards. **Holiness:** God's transcendent holiness requires mediation (Moses, priests), separation from profane, and sacrificial atonement for sin. **Presence of God:** The Tabernacle (Exodus 25-40) enables holy God to dwell among sinful people, with glory cloud indicating divine presence. **Priesthood/Mediation:** Aaron and Levites mediate between God and people, prefiguring Christ's high priesthood (Hebrews). **Sacrifice/Atonement:** Blood sacrifice atones for sin, with Passover lamb foreshadowing Christ (1 Corinthians 5:7). **Faithfulness vs. Rebellion:** Israel's murmuring, golden calf idolatry, and Moses's intercession establish patterns of human failure and divine patience. **Divine Name:** Yahweh's self-revelation (Exodus 3:14, "I AM WHO I AM") discloses God's eternal, self-existent nature. These themes permeate both Testaments, with Exodus providing theological vocabulary for understanding salvation, law, worship, and covenant.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Archaeological evidence for the Exodus remains contentious and indirect. **Egyptian sources** include: the **Merneptah Stele** (1208 BCE), earliest extra-biblical reference to "Israel" as a people in Canaan; **Leiden Papyrus 348** mentioning "Apiru" (possibly "Hebrew") workers; tomb paintings showing **Semitic slaves in Egypt** (Beni Hasan, c. 1900 BCE); evidence of **Asiatic populations in Goshen region** during Second Intermediate Period (Hyksos); **Pi-Ramesse** (Ramesses II's Delta capital, possibly biblical Rameses, Exodus 1:11); and **brick-making scenes** matching biblical descriptions. **Challenges** include: no Egyptian records explicitly mentioning exodus (though Egypt rarely recorded defeats); no archaeological evidence for 2+ million people in Sinai; debates over conquest vs. gradual infiltration models in Canaan. **Mt. Sinai** location remains uncertain, with traditional **Jebel Musa** (southern Sinai) having ancient Christian tradition but no definitive archaeological confirmation. Alternative theories include northern Sinai, Transjordan (Mt. Seir), or northwest Arabia. **Kadesh-barnea** (Tell el-Qudeirat) shows Late Bronze/Iron I occupation consistent with biblical chronology. The **Amarna Letters** (14th century BCE) describe "Habiru" disrupting Canaan, possibly related to Israelite presence. Scholarly consensus ranges from viewing Exodus as historical core with legendary elaboration, to seeing it as theological mythology with minimal historical basis, to maintaining essential historical reliability despite archaeological gaps. The debate continues, with evidence neither definitively confirming nor refuting the biblical account.

**Structure:** Exodus comprises 40 chapters organized around three major movements: **Deliverance from Egypt** (chapters 1-18), **Covenant at Sinai** (chapters 19-24), and **Tabernacle Instructions** (chapters 25-40). **Part I (1-18)** narrates Israel's oppression in Egypt (1-2), Moses's call and confrontation with Pharaoh (3-11), the Passover and exodus (12-13), Red Sea crossing and wilderness journey to Sinai (14-18). **Part II (19-24)** describes the Sinai theophany, Ten Commandments, and covenant ceremony, establishing Israel as Yahweh's covenant people through law. **Part III (25-40)** details Tabernacle design and construction, interrupted by the golden calf apostasy (32-34) and Moses's intercession, concluding with the glory cloud filling the completed sanctuary. The structure moves from physical deliverance to spiritual relationship (covenant) to worship infrastructure (Tabernacle), showing salvation leads to covenant which requires holy worship. Literary genres include historical narrative, poetry (Song of the Sea, Exodus 15), legal codes (casuistic and apodictic law), and architectural specifications. The book opens with Israel in slavery, crying to God, and closes with God dwelling among them in glory—a movement from oppression to divine presence that establishes the pattern for all biblical redemption. Exodus serves as Israel's founding national document, establishing identity, worship, and covenant relationship that shapes all subsequent biblical theology and practice.

### Exodus Chapter 1

*[Chapter text unavailable]*

### Exodus Chapter 2

And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took
to wife
 a daughter of Levi.
And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he
was a goodly
child, she hid him three months.
And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid
it in the flags by the river’s brink.
And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash
herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
And when she had opened
it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This
is one
 of the Hebrews’ children.
Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother.
And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give
thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.
And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that
there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.
Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew
water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How
is it that
 ye are come so soon to day?
And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew
water enough for us, and watered the flock.
And he said unto his daughters, And where
is he? why
is it
that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
And she bare
him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto
them.

### Exodus Chapter 3

Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God,
even to Horeb.
And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush
was not consumed.
And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here
am I.
And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
Moreover he said, I
am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which
are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;
And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
And Moses said unto God, Who
am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this
shall be
 a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
And Moses said unto God, Behold,
when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?
And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.
And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this
is my name for ever, and this
is my memorial unto all generations.
Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and
seen that which is done to you in Egypt:
And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.
And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.
And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:
But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put
them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.


### Exodus Chapter 4

And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.
And the LORD said unto him, What
is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.
And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:
That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.
And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand
was leprous as snow.
And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his
other flesh.
And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour
it upon the dry
land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry
land.
And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I
am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I
am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?
Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.
And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand
of him whom
 thou wilt send.
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,
Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.
And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.
And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,
even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.
And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.
And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which
are
 in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.
And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.
And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel
is
 my son,
even my firstborn:
And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son,
even thy firstborn.
And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.
Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast
it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband
art thou to me.
So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband
thou art,
 because of the circumcision.
And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.
And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.
And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:
And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.
And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.


### Exodus Chapter 5

And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.
And Pharaoh said, Who
is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.
And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.
And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.
And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now
are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish
ought thereof: for they
be
 idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go
and sacrifice to our God.
Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.
And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.
So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.
And the taskmasters hasted
them, saying, Fulfil your works,
your daily tasks, as when there was straw.
And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten,
and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?
Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?
There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants
are beaten; but the fault
is in thine own people.
But he said, Ye
are idle,
ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go
and do sacrifice to the LORD.
Go therefore now,
and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.
And the officers of the children of Israel did see
that they
were in evil
case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish
ought from your bricks of your daily task.
And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:
And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.
And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou
so evil entreated this people? why
is it
that
 thou hast sent me?
For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

### Exodus Chapter 6

Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.
And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I
am the LORD:
And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by
the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.
And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.
And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.
Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I
am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:
And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I
am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I
am the LORD.
And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who
am
 of uncircumcised lips?
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
These
be the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these
be the families of Reuben.
And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these
are the families of Simeon.
And these
are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi
were an hundred thirty and seven years.
The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.
And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath
were an hundred thirty and three years.
And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these
are the families of Levi according to their generations.
And Amram took him Jochebed his father’s sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram
were an hundred and thirty and seven years.
And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.
And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.
And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these
are the families of the Korhites.
And Eleazar Aaron’s son took him
one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these
are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.
These
are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.
These
are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these
are that Moses and Aaron.
And it came to pass on the day
when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt,
That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I
am the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.
And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I
am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?


### Exodus Chapter 7

And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.
Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.
And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies,
and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
And the Egyptians shall know that I
am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.
And Moses
was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast
it before Pharaoh,
and it shall become a serpent.
And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.
For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.
And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh’s heart
is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.
Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.
And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.
Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I
am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that
is in mine hand upon the waters which
are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
And the fish that
is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and
that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in
vessels of wood, and in
vessels of stone.
And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that
were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that
were
 in the river were turned to blood.
And the fish that
was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.
And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.
And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.


### Exodus Chapter 8

And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
And if thou refuse to let
them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:
And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:
And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.
And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.
And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses,
that they may remain in the river only?
And he said, To morrow. And he said,
Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that
there is none like unto the LORD our God.
And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.
And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.
And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.
And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.
But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.
Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This
is the finger of God: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms
of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms
of flies, and also the ground whereon they
are.
And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms
of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I
am the LORD in the midst of the earth.
And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.
And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm
of flies
 into the house of Pharaoh, and
into his servants’ houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm
of flies.And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.
And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?
We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.
And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me.
And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms
of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.
And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.
And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms
of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.
And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.


### Exodus Chapter 9

Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
For if thou refuse to let
them go, and wilt hold them still,
Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which
is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep:
there shall be a very grievous murrain.
And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all
that is the children’s of Israel.
And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.
And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth
with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth
with
 blains upon man, and upon beast.
And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that
there is
 none like me in all the earth.
For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
And in very deed for this
cause have I raised thee up, for to shew
in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?
Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.
Send therefore now,
and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field;
for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:
And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that
was
 in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.
Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel
were,
 was there no hail.
And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD
is righteous, and I and my people
are wicked.
Intreat the LORD (for
it is enough) that there be no
more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.
And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD;
and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth
is the LORD’S.
But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.
And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax
was bolled.
But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they
were
 not grown up.
And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.


### Exodus Chapter 10

And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:
And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I
am the LORD.
And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.
Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:
And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:
And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?
And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God:
but who
are they that shall go?
And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we
must hold a feast unto the LORD.
And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look
to it; for evil
is before you.
Not so: go now ye
that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land,
even all that the hail hath left.
And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all
that night;
and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous
were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.
Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.
And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.
And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness
which
 may be felt.
And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:
They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.
And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.
Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.
And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in
that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.
And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.

### Exodus Chapter 11

And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague
more
 upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let
you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.
Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.
And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses
was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people.
And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:
And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that
is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.
And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.
But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.
And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.


### Exodus Chapter 12

And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
This month
shall be unto you the beginning of months: it
shall be the first month of the year to you.
Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth
day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of
their fathers, a lamb for an house:
And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take
it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.
Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take
it out from the sheep, or from the goats:
And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
And they shall take of the blood, and strike
it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.
And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread;
and with bitter
herbs they shall eat it.
Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast
with
 fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.
And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
And thus shall ye eat it;
with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it
is the LORD’S passover.
For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I
am the LORD.
And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye
are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy
you, when I smite the land of Egypt.
And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.
Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
And in the first day
there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save
that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.
And ye shall observe
the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.
In the first
month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.
Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.
Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.
Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.
And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip
it in the blood that
is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that
is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.
For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite
you.
And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.
And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?
That ye shall say, It
is the sacrifice of the LORD’S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.
And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that
was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.
And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for
there was not a house where
there was not one dead.
And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,
and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.
Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.
And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We
be all dead
men.
And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:
And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them
such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.
And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot
that were men, beside children.
And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds,
even very much cattle.
And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.
Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt,
was four hundred and thirty years.
And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
It
is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this
is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.
And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This
is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:
But every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.
A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.
In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.
All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.
Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
And it came to pass the selfsame day,
that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.


### Exodus Chapter 13

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel,
both of man and of beast: it
is mine.
And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this
place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
This day came ye out in the month Abib.
And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.
Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day
shall be a feast to the LORD.
Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.
And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying,
This is done
 because of that
which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.
And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD’S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.
Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.
And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,
That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males
shall be the LORD’S.
And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.
And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What
is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:
And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.
And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.
And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not
through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that
was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:
But God led the people about,
through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.
And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.
And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:
He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night,
from before the people.


### Exodus Chapter 14

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.
For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They
are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.
And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I
am the LORD. And they did so.
And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:
And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.
And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.
But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses
and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.
And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.
And they said unto Moses, Because
there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?
Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For
it had been
 better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.
The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:
But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry
ground through the midst of the sea.
And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
And the Egyptians shall know that I
am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:
And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness
to them, but it gave light by night
to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.
And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go
back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry
land, and the waters were divided.
And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry
ground: and the waters
were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea,
even all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,
And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.
And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen,
and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.
But the children of Israel walked upon dry
land in the midst of the sea; and the waters
were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.
And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.


### Exodus Chapter 15

Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
The LORD
is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he
is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father’s God, and I will exalt him.
The LORD
is a man of war: the LORD
is his name.
Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.
The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.
Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.
And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath,
which consumed them as stubble.
And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap,
and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.
The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.
Who
is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who
is
 like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful
in praises, doing wonders?
Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.
Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people
which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided
them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.
The people shall hear,
and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.
Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.
Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be
as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over,
which thou hast purchased.
Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance,
in the place, O LORD,
which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord,
which thy hands have established.
The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.
For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry
land in the midst of the sea.
And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they
were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.
And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree,
which
 when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,
And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I
am the LORD that healeth thee.
And they came to Elim, where
were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.

### Exodus Chapter 16

And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which
is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:
And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots,
and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.
And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare
that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:
And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what
are we, that ye murmur against us?
And Moses said,
This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what
are
 we? your murmurings
are not against us, but against the LORD.
And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.
And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I
am the LORD your God.
And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.
And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness
there lay a small round thing,
as small as the hoar frost on the ground.
And when the children of Israel saw
it, they said one to another, It
is manna: for they wist not what it
was.
 And Moses said unto them, This
is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.
This
is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man
according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for
them which
are in his tents.
And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.
And when they did mete
it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.
And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.
And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
And it came to pass,
that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one
man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
And he said unto them, This
is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow
is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake
that which ye will bake
to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.
And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day
is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.
Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day,
which is
 the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
And it came to pass,
that there went out
some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.
And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?
See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
So the people rested on the seventh day.
And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it
was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it
was
 like wafers
made with honey.
And Moses said, This
is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.
As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.
Now an omer
is the tenth
part of an ephah.

### Exodus Chapter 32

And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for
as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which
are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring
them unto me.
And all the people brake off the golden earrings which
were
 in their ears, and brought
them unto Aaron.
And he received
them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These
be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
And when Aaron saw
it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow
is a feast to the LORD.
And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted
themselves:
They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These
be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it
is a stiffnecked people:
Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.
And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?
Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit
it for ever.
And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.
And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony
were in his hand: the tables
were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other
were they written.
And the tables
were the work of God, and the writing
was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses,
There is a noise of war in the camp.
And he said,
It is not the voice of
them that shout for mastery, neither
is it the voice of
them that cry for being overcome:
but the noise of
them that sing do I hear.
And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.
And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt
it in the fire, and ground
it to powder, and strawed
it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink
of it.
And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?
And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are
set on mischief.
For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for
as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break
it off. So they gave
it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
And when Moses saw that the people
were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto
their shame among their enemies:)
Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who
is
 on the LORD’S side?
let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.
And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side,
and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.
And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.
And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.
And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.
Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
Therefore now go, lead the people unto
the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.
And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.


### Exodus Chapter 33

And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart,
and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:
And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou
art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.
And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.
For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye
are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.
And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.
And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass,
that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which
was without the camp.
And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,
that
 all the people rose up, and stood every man
at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.
And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood
at the door of the tabernacle, and
the LORD talked with Moses.
And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand
at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man
in his tent door.
And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.
And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.
Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation
is thy people.
And he said, My presence shall go
with thee, and I will give thee rest.
And he said unto him, If thy presence go not
with me, carry us not up hence.
For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight?
is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that
are
 upon the face of the earth.
And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.
And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.
And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.
And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.
And the LORD said, Behold,
there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:
And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:
And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.


### Exodus Chapter 34

And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon
these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.
And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.
And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.
And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.
And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,
Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear
the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and to the fourth
generation.
And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.
And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it
is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.
And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou
art shall see the work of the LORD: for it
is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.
Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:
For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name
is Jealous,
is a jealous God:
Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and
one
 call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;
And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.
Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.
All that openeth the matrix
is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle,
whether ox or sheep,
that is male.
But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem
him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year’s end.
Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.
For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.
Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.
The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.
And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.
And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.
And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.
And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.
And
till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.
But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel
that which he was commanded.
And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.


### Exodus Chapter 35

And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These
are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that
ye should do them.
Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.
Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.
And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This
is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,
Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever
is
 of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass,
And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’
hair,
And rams’ skins dyed red, and badgers’ skins, and shittim wood,
And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,
And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.
And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded;
The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,
The ark, and the staves thereof,
with the mercy seat, and the vail of the covering,
The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread,
The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,
And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle,
The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,
The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,
The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,
The cloths of service, to do service in the holy
place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office.
And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing,
and they brought the LORD’S offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.
And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted,
and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered
offered an offering of gold unto the LORD.
And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’
hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers’ skins, brought
them.
Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD’S offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought
it.
And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun,
both of blue, and of purple,
and of scarlet, and of fine linen.
And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats’
hair.
And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;
And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.
The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.
And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;
And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;
And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
And in the cutting of stones, to set
them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.
And he hath put in his heart that he may teach,
both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver,
even
 of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.

### Exodus Chapter 36

Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.
And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom,
even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:
And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it
withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.
And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;
And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.
And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.
For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains
of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet:
with cherubims of cunning work made he them.
The length of one curtain
was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains
were all of one size.
And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and
the other
 five curtains he coupled one unto another.
And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of
another
 curtain, in the coupling of the second.
Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which
was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one
curtain to another.
And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.
And he made curtains
of goats’
hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.
The length of one curtain
was thirty cubits, and four cubits
was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains
were
 of one size.
And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.
And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.
And he made fifty taches
of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.
And he made a covering for the tent
of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering
of badgers’ skins above
that.And he made boards for the tabernacle
of shittim wood, standing up.
The length of a board
was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.
One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.
And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:
And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.
And for the other side of the tabernacle,
which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards,
And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.
And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.
And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.
And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.
And there were eight boards; and their sockets
were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.
And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.
And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.
And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings
of
 gold
to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
And he made a vail
of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen:
with cherubims made he it of cunning work.
And he made thereunto four pillars
of shittim
wood,
 and overlaid them with gold: their hooks
were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.
And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door
of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;
And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets
were of
 brass.


### Exodus Chapter 37

And Bezaleel made the ark
of shittim wood: two cubits and a half
was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:
And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.
And he cast for it four rings of gold,
to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it.
And he made staves
of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.
And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.
And he made the mercy seat
of pure gold: two cubits and a half
was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.
And he made two cherubims
of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;
One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the
other
 end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.
And the cherubims spread out
their wings on high,
and
 covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another;
even
to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.
And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits
was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof:
And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about.
Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.
And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that
were in the four feet thereof.
Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.
And he made the staves
of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.
And he made the vessels which
were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal,
of
 pure gold.
And he made the candlestick
of pure gold:
of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same:
And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:
Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick.
And in the candlestick
were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers:
And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.
Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it
was
 one beaten work
of pure gold.
And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes,
of pure gold.
Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.
And he made the incense altar
of shittim wood: the length of it
was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it
was
 foursquare; and two cubits
was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.
And he overlaid it with pure gold,
both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about.
And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal.
And he made the staves
of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.
And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.


### Exodus Chapter 38

And he made the altar of burnt offering
of shittim wood: five cubits
was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof;
it was foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.
And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.
And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons,
and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he
of brass.
And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.
And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass,
to be places for the staves.
And he made the staves
of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass.
And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.
And he made the laver
of brass, and the foot of it
of
 brass, of the lookingglasses of
the women assembling, which assembled
at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court
were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits:
Their pillars
were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets
were of silver.
And for the north side
the hangings were an hundred cubits, their pillars
were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets
of silver.
And for the west side
were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets
of silver.
And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.
The hangings of the one side
of the gate were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.
And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand,
were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.
All the hangings of the court round about
were of fine twined linen.
And the sockets for the pillars
were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets
of silver; and the overlaying of their chapiters
of silver; and all the pillars of the court
were
 filleted with silver.
And the hanging for the gate of the court
was needlework,
of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits
was the length, and the height in the breadth
was
 five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.
And their pillars
were four, and their sockets
of
 brass four; their hooks
of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets
of silver.
And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about,
were of brass.
This is the sum of the tabernacle,
even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses,
for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest.
And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.
And with him
was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.
All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy
place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation
was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:
A bekah for every man,
that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty
men.
And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.
And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five
shekels
 he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them.
And the brass of the offering
was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.
And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,
And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.


### Exodus Chapter 39

And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy
place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.
And he made the ephod
of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut
it into
 wires, to work
it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen,
with cunning work.
They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple
it together: by the two edges was it coupled together.
And the curious girdle of his ephod, that
was upon it,
was of the same, according to the work thereof;
of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.
And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.
And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod,
that they should be
 stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.
And he made the breastplate
of cunning work, like the work of the ephod;
of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span
was
 the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof,
being
 doubled.
And they set in it four rows of stones:
the first row
was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this
was the first row.
And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.
And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.
And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper:
they were
 inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.
And the stones
were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names,
like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.
And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends,
of
 wreathen work
of pure gold.
And they made two ouches
of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.
And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.
And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it.
And they made two rings of gold, and put
them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which
was on the side of the ephod inward.
And they made two
other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the
other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.
And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.
And he made the robe of the ephod
of woven work, all
of blue.
And
there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon,
with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.
And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates
of blue, and purple, and scarlet,
and twined
linen.
And they made bells
of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;
A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister
in; as the LORD commanded Moses.
And they made coats
of fine linen
of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,
And a mitre
of fine linen, and goodly bonnets
of
 fine linen, and linen breeches
of fine twined linen,
And a girdle
of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet,
of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.
And they made the plate of the holy crown
of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing,
like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten
it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.
Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.
And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets,
And the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers’ skins, and the vail of the covering,
The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,
The table,
and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,
The pure candlestick,
with the lamps thereof,
even with
 the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,
And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,
The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,
The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,
The cloths of service to do service in the holy
place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons’ garments, to minister in the priest’s office.
According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.
And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they have done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.

## Leviticus

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Leviticus narrates instructions given during Israel's wilderness period at Mount Sinai, positioned chronologically between Exodus 40 (erection of the Tabernacle) and Numbers 1 (census). Traditional dating places these events ca. 1446-1445 BCE (early Exodus chronology) or 1290-1250 BCE (late chronology). However, the book's composition date remains intensely debated. Traditional Jewish and Christian interpretation attributes authorship to Moses during the wilderness period. Critical scholarship, following the Documentary Hypothesis, identifies Leviticus as the Priestly (P) source, composed during or after the Babylonian exile (6th-5th centuries BCE), though incorporating earlier ritual traditions. Linguistic analysis reveals late Hebrew features, and the highly systematized priestly theology reflects developed cultic practice. Many scholars propose that earlier ritual traditions from the First Temple period were compiled and edited by post-exilic priests seeking to reconstruct worship practices after exile. The Holiness Code (chapters 17-26) may represent a distinct tradition integrated into the broader priestly material. Archaeological evidence for wilderness period sacrifice is absent (expected given nomadic context), but comparative ancient Near Eastern ritual texts (Ugaritic, Hittite) illuminate similar sacrificial systems predating Israel.

**Author and Audience:** Traditional attribution to Moses rests on references like "the LORD spoke to Moses" appearing throughout (though this establishes divine authority rather than necessarily Mosaic authorship). Critical scholarship identifies priestly circles as composers/editors during the exilic or post-exilic period. The systematic organization, technical terminology, and priestly perspective suggest composition by Jerusalem priests concerned with ritual purity, sacrificial procedures, and covenant holiness. The intended audience would be post-exilic Jewish community seeking to restore proper worship and maintain covenant relationship through ritual observance. Priestly concerns dominate: access to God through mediation, atonement for sin, purity regulations distinguishing Israel from surrounding nations, and holiness as central covenant requirement. The book addresses both priests (specific instructions for sacrificial procedures) and laity (purity laws, ethical commands). For exilic/post-exilic Jews without temple (destroyed 586 BCE, rebuilt 516 BCE), Leviticus provided authoritative guide for reconstruction and maintained theological emphasis that relationship with holy God requires mediation, sacrifice for sin, and distinct lifestyle. The book's emphasis on land and exile (chapter 26) speaks directly to exilic experience, interpreting exile as covenant curse for disobedience while holding hope for restoration through repentance.

**Key Themes:** Holiness serves as Leviticus's central theme, repeated in the key phrase "be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy" (11:44-45; 19:2; 20:7, 26). Holiness involves both ritual purity (ceremonial cleanness) and ethical righteousness (moral behavior), requiring separation from defilement and dedication to God. The sacrificial system establishes means of atonement: burnt offerings (total dedication), grain offerings (thanksgiving), peace offerings (fellowship), sin offerings (unintentional sin), and guilt offerings (restitution required). The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur, chapter 16) provides annual comprehensive atonement for all sins, establishing that relationship with holy God requires dealing with sin through blood sacrifice. Purity laws (chapters 11-15) distinguish clean from unclean, regulating diet, bodily discharges, skin diseases, creating symbolic system distinguishing life from death, order from chaos. The Aaronic priesthood mediates between holy God and sinful people, with elaborate consecration rituals (chapter 8) and ongoing responsibilities. Covenant blessings and curses (chapter 26) demonstrate that obedience brings life, prosperity, security, while disobedience brings disaster, exile, death. Jubilee and sabbatical year laws (chapter 25) emphasize that land belongs to God, preventing permanent alienation of ancestral property and requiring periodic redistribution, reflecting social justice within theological framework. The book develops theology of God's presence among his people—the holy God dwells in the sanctuary but remains dangerous if approached improperly, requiring careful regulation of access.

**Archaeological Relevance:** While direct archaeological evidence for wilderness Tabernacle and sacrifices is absent (unsurprising given nomadic context and perishable materials), comparative ancient Near Eastern evidence illuminates Leviticus's ritual system. Sacrificial practices described in Leviticus parallel those in Ugaritic texts (14th-13th centuries BCE), Hittite ritual texts, and Mesopotamian cultic practices, demonstrating that Israel's sacrificial system shares features with broader ancient Near Eastern ritual traditions while maintaining distinctive theological emphases (exclusive monotheism, ethical dimensions of holiness). Archaeological evidence of Israelite worship from Iron Age includes: horned altars at Tel Dan, Beersheba, and Megiddo; high place remains showing local worship sites; faunal remains from sacrificial sites showing animal bones consistent with Levitical requirements; Arad temple with tripartite structure similar to Tabernacle/temple descriptions. The Qumran community (Dead Sea Scrolls, 2nd century BCE-1st century CE) demonstrates continued devotion to Levitical purity laws and sacrificial theology, with texts like 11QTemple expanding Levitical regulations. Inscriptions like the Khirbet Beit Lei inscriptions reference ritual purity concerns. The absence of pig bones in Iron Age Israelite sites (contrasting with Philistine sites) suggests dietary restrictions similar to Leviticus 11 were practiced, providing archaeological marker of ethnic/religious identity. Post-exilic Yehud province archaeology shows temple reconstruction and renewed emphasis on cult, consistent with Leviticus's role in restoration.

**Structure:** The book contains 27 chapters organized around distinct ritual and legal sections: (1) Sacrificial laws (chapters 1-7): instructions for five major offerings—burnt, grain, peace, sin, guilt—addressed to laity (1-5) and priests (6-7); (2) Priestly consecration and inauguration (chapters 8-10): Aaron and sons consecrated, inaugural sacrifices, Nadab and Abihu's unauthorized fire and death, establishing importance of proper approach to holy God; (3) Purity laws (chapters 11-15): clean and unclean animals, childbirth purification, skin diseases and mildew, bodily discharges; (4) Day of Atonement (chapter 16): annual ritual purifying sanctuary and people, scapegoat symbolism; (5) Holiness Code (chapters 17-26): regulations for holy living including sacrificial procedures, sexual ethics, social justice, ritual calendar, sabbatical and Jubilee years, covenant blessings and curses; (6) Vow regulations (chapter 27): valuations for vowed persons, animals, houses, fields. The structure moves from ritual regulations establishing proper worship, through purity laws maintaining boundaries between holy and profane, to comprehensive holiness requirements encompassing all life areas. The Holiness Code (chapters 17-26) likely represents earlier independent tradition integrated into the priestly framework, distinguished by its ethical emphasis and repeated refrain "I am the LORD." The book's concluding blessings and curses (chapter 26) mirror ancient Near Eastern treaty structures, presenting covenant relationship requiring faithfulness with consequences for obedience or rebellion. Leviticus functions as manual for Israel's priestly worship and covenant faithfulness, emphasizing that the holy God dwelling among his people requires holiness in all aspects of life—ritual, ethical, social, economic.

### Leviticus Chapter 22

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name
in those things which they hallow unto me: I
am the LORD.
Say unto them, Whosoever
he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I
am the LORD.
What man soever of the seed of Aaron
is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing
that is unclean
by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;
Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;
The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.
And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it
is his food.
That which dieth of itself, or is torn
with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I
am the LORD.
They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.
There shall no stranger eat
of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat
of the holy thing.
But if the priest buy
any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.
If the priest’s daughter also be
married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.
But if the priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.
And if a man eat
of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth
part thereof unto it, and shall give
it
 unto the priest with the holy thing.
And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;
Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever
he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;
Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.
But whatsoever hath a blemish,
that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish
his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.
Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer
for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make
any offering thereof in your land.
Neither from a stranger’s hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption
is in them,
and
 blemishes
be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
And
whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer
it at your own will.
On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I
am the LORD.
Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I
am
 the LORD.
Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I
am the LORD which hallow you,
That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I
am
 the LORD.


### Leviticus Chapter 23

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,
Concerning
 the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim
to be holy convocations,
even these
are my feasts.
Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day
is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work
therein: it
is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.
These
are the feasts of the LORD,
even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.
In the fourteenth
day of the first month at even
is
 the LORD’S passover.
And on the fifteenth day of the same month
is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.
In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day
is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work
therein.And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:
And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.
And the meat offering thereof
shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD
for
 a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof
shall be of wine, the fourth
part of an hin.
And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God:
it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:
Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.
Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven;
they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.
And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be
for
 a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings,
even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.
Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.
And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits
for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day,
that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work
therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I
am the LORD your God.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first
day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.
Ye shall do no servile work
therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Also on the tenth
day of this seventh month
there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it
is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.
For whatsoever soul
it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.
And whatsoever soul
it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.
Ye shall do no manner of work:
it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
It
shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth
day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month
shall be the feast of tabernacles
for seven days unto the LORD.
On the first day
shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work
therein.
Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it
is a solemn assembly;
and ye shall do no servile work
therein.
These
are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim
to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:
Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.
Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day
shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day
shall be
 a sabbath.
And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.
And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year.
It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:
That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I
am
 the LORD your God.
And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.


### Leviticus Chapter 24

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.
Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually:
it shall be a statute for ever in your generations.
He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.
And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.
And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD.
And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon
each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial,
even an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually,
being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.
And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it
is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.
And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father
was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish
woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
And the Israelitish woman’s son blasphemed the name
of the LORD,
 and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother’s name
was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)
And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard
him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death,
and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name
of the LORD, shall be put to death.
And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.
And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;
Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him
again.
And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.
Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I
am the LORD your God.
And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.


### Leviticus Chapter 25

And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.
Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;
But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed:
for it is a year of rest unto the land.
And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,
And for thy cattle, and for the beast that
are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.
And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.
Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth
day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout
all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather
the grapes
 in it of thy vine undressed.
For it
is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.
And if thou sell
ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour’s hand, ye shall not oppress one another:
According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour,
and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:
According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for
according to the number
of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.
Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I
am the LORD your God.
Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:
Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat
yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat
of
 the old
store.The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land
is mine; for ye
are strangers and sojourners with me.
And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away
some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.
And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;
Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.
But if he be not able to restore
it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold;
within a full year may he redeem it.
And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that
is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.
But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.
Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites,
and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in
the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites
are their possession among the children of Israel.
But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him:
yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.
Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
I
am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan,
and to be your God.
And if thy brother
that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:
But as an hired servant,
and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee,
and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:
And
then shall he depart from thee,
both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
For they
are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.
Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.
Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that
are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.
And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit
them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.
And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother
that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger
or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family:
After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:
Either his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or
any
 that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.
And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.
If
there be yet many years
behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him,
and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him:
and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.
And if he be not redeemed in these
years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile,
both he, and his children with him.
For unto me the children of Israel
are servants; they
are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I
am the LORD your God.

### Leviticus Chapter 26

Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up
any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I
am the LORD your God.
Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I
am
 the LORD.
If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make
you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.
And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.
And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
I
am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.
But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;
And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments,
but that ye break my covenant:
I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:
And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your
high ways shall be desolate.
And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;
Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of
my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver
you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.
And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.
Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies’ land;
even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.
As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
And upon them that are left
alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;
And
that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I
am the LORD their God.
But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I
am the LORD.
These
are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.


### Leviticus Chapter 27

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons
shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.
And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
And if it
be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
And if
it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
And if
it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation
shall be three shekels of silver.
And if
it be from sixty years old and above; if
it be
 a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
And if
it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that
any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.
He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
And if
it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:
And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it,
who art the priest, so shall it be.
But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth
part
 thereof unto thy estimation.
And when a man shall sanctify his house
to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth
part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD
some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed
shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth
part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.
And if
a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which
is not of the fields of his possession;
Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation,
even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day,
as a holy thing unto the LORD.
In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought,
even to him to whom the possession of the land
did belong.
And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD’S firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether
it be ox, or sheep: it
is
 the LORD’S.
And if
it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth
part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath,
both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing
is most holy unto the LORD.
None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed;
but shall surely be put to death.
And all the tithe of the land,
whether of the seed of the land,
or of the fruit of the tree,
is the LORD’S:
it is holy unto the LORD.
And if a man will at all redeem
ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth
part thereof.
And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock,
even
 of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.
He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
These
are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

## Numbers

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** The book of Numbers narrates Israel's wilderness wanderings from Mount Sinai to the plains of Moab, spanning traditionally 38 years (the "40 years" includes two years at Sinai covered in Exodus-Leviticus-Numbers 1-10). The events described would date to ca. 1445-1407 BCE (early Exodus chronology) or 1290-1250 BCE (late chronology). The book's composition date, however, differs significantly from its setting. Traditional Jewish and Christian interpretation attributes authorship to Moses, based on references like "Moses wrote down their starting places" (33:2). Critical scholarship, following the Documentary Hypothesis, identifies multiple sources: Priestly (P), Jahwist (J), and Elohist (E) materials compiled during or after the Babylonian exile (6th-5th centuries BCE). The Priestly material (census lists, itinerary, ritual laws) dominates, suggesting priestly editorial shaping. Some traditions may preserve authentic wilderness period memories, but the book's final form reflects later theological concerns—particularly explaining delayed land possession and addressing exile community's questions about God's faithfulness despite prolonged displacement. Archaeological evidence for wilderness wandering remains elusive (expected given nomadic lifestyle), though sites like Kadesh-barnea show Late Bronze Age occupation, and Edomite/Moabite kingdoms mentioned align with Iron Age I state formation.

**Author and Audience:** Traditional Mosaic authorship faces challenges: the book refers to Moses in third person, includes statements requiring hindsight ("now the man Moses was very humble, more than anyone else on earth"—12:3), and concludes with events after Moses' activity. Critical scholarship identifies composite authorship with significant Priestly editing. The census lists, genealogies, and ritual regulations reflect priestly concerns with organization, purity, and proper worship. Rebellion narratives may incorporate earlier traditions shaped by later editors. The intended audience would be post-exilic Jewish community for whom the wilderness wandering provided powerful analogy: like the wilderness generation, they experienced displacement from the promised land; like that generation, they faced questions of divine faithfulness and covenant relationship during prolonged waiting. The book addresses theological questions: Why did land possession take so long? Why did the exodus generation die in wilderness? How should the community organize itself? What constitutes faithful response to God's presence? The emphasis on priestly leadership, proper worship, and covenant obedience speaks to post-exilic concerns about maintaining identity and relationship with God without immediate fulfillment of land promises. The book functions as warning against rebellion and encouragement that despite human unfaithfulness, God remains faithful to covenant purposes.

**Key Themes:** Divine presence among the people forms a central theme: the cloud and pillar of fire guide movement (9:15-23), and God speaks from the Tent of Meeting. The dangerous holiness of God's presence requires strict regulations—unauthorized approach brings death (chapters 16-17). Rebellion and judgment appear throughout: at Taberah (11:1-3), over food (11:4-34), Miriam and Aaron's challenge (chapter 12), the spy report and refusal to enter Canaan (chapters 13-14), Korah's rebellion (chapters 16-17), Moses' disobedience at Meribah (20:1-13). These narratives demonstrate consequences of covenant unfaithfulness while establishing that even leaders face judgment for disobedience. The transition from exodus generation to conquest generation structures the book—the faithless generation dies in wilderness (chapter 14), while a new generation prepares for conquest (chapter 26 second census). Priestly authority receives emphasis through rebellion narratives vindicating Aaron's priesthood (chapters 16-18) and establishing Levitical roles. The journey motif shows Israel's movement toward the promised land despite setbacks, presenting pilgrimage as metaphor for covenant relationship. Balaam's oracles (chapters 22-24) provide prophetic perspective affirming God's blessing on Israel despite external curses. The book also emphasizes holiness requirements for the covenant community through purity laws, Nazirite vow regulations, and instructions for maintaining camp purity when God dwells among them.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Archaeological evidence relating to Numbers is limited but illuminating. Kadesh-barnea (Ein el-Qudeirat), Israel's wilderness base (13:26; 20:1), shows occupation during the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age I, though identifying specific Israelite presence is impossible. The absence of substantial permanent settlements in the Sinai and Negev during this period aligns with nomadic wilderness existence described. Surveys reveal numerous small sites and campsites that could correspond to wilderness period nomadic groups. The Edomite, Moabite, and Ammonite kingdoms mentioned (chapters 20-21) emerged as organized states during Iron Age I (12th-10th centuries BCE), consistent with late Exodus chronology but problematic for early chronology. The "King's Highway" mentioned (20:17; 21:22) is confirmed as major Transjordanian trade route in ancient Near Eastern texts. The site of Mount Hor (Aaron's death, 20:22-29) is traditionally identified with Jebel Harun near Petra. Egyptian texts describe nomadic groups in the Sinai and Negev region during the Late Bronze Age, providing context for wilderness wandering. The Balaam traditions find remarkable extra-biblical confirmation in the Deir 'Alla inscription (8th century BCE Jordan) mentioning "Balaam son of Beor" as a seer who received divine revelations—the same name and patronymic as Numbers 22-24, confirming Balaam's status in Transjordanian tradition. The serpent symbolism (bronze serpent, 21:4-9) finds parallels in ancient Near Eastern iconography. The census numbers (603,550 men in chapter 1) present historical challenges—such a population (2+ million total) exceeds what Sinai/Negev could support and conflicts with archaeological evidence for Canaan's population, leading scholars to propose symbolic/schematic interpretation or later editorial expansion.

**Structure:** The book contains 36 chapters organized in three major sections following geographical movement: (1) At Sinai (chapters 1-10): census and camp organization, Levitical duties, Nazirite vow, priestly blessing, Tabernacle dedication, Passover observance, cloud guidance—preparing for departure; (2) Sinai to Kadesh and wilderness wandering (chapters 10-21): departure from Sinai, complaints and judgments, spy mission and refusal to enter Canaan, judgment of 40-year wandering, Korah's rebellion, Aaron's budding staff, bronze serpent, victories over Sihon and Og, approaching promised land; (3) On plains of Moab preparing for conquest (chapters 22-36): Balaam's oracles, apostasy at Peor, second census, inheritance laws, Joshua's commissioning, ritual calendar, vow regulations, Midianite war, Transjordanian tribal allotments, itinerary review, Canaan boundary definitions, Levitical cities and cities of refuge. The structure emphasizes Israel's progress despite rebellion—from Sinai preparation through wilderness judgment to Moab readiness. The first generation's faithlessness (spy report, chapter 14) contrasts with the second generation's victories (chapters 21, 31). The census lists bookend the wilderness period (chapters 1 and 26), showing generational transition. Priestly and legal materials interrupt narrative flow, reflecting composite composition and priestly editorial concerns. The book's title "Numbers" (from Greek/Latin translation) focuses on census lists, but Hebrew title "In the Wilderness" (B'midbar) better captures the book's theme—Israel's journey through testing toward promise, requiring faithfulness to the covenant God who remains present among them despite their repeated failures.

### Numbers Chapter 1

And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first
day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of
their
 names, every male by their polls;
From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.
And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers.
And these
are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of
the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.
Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
Of Judah; Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

Of Asher; Pagiel the son of Ocran.
Of Gad; Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
Of Naphtali; Ahira the son of Enan.
These
were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.
And Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by
their
 names:
And they assembled all the congregation together on the first
day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.
As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.
And the children of Reuben, Israel’s eldest son, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Those that were numbered of them,
even of the tribe of Reuben,
were forty and six thousand and five hundred.
Of the children of Simeon, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, those that were numbered of them, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Those that were numbered of them,
even of the tribe of Simeon,
were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.
Of the children of Gad, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;
Those that were numbered of them,
even of the tribe of Gad,

belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.
And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.
But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.
And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

### Numbers Chapter 25

And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.
And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.
And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.
And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal-peor.
And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who
were weeping
before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw
it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;
And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:
And he shall have it, and his seed after him,
even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.
Now the name of the Israelite that was slain,
even that was slain with the Midianitish woman,
was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.
And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain
was
 Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he
was head over a people,
and of a chief house in Midian.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Vex the Midianites, and smite them:
For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor’s sake.

For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.


### Numbers Chapter 27

Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.
And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation,
by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.
Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us
therefore a possession among the brethren of our father.
And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father’s brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.
And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father’s brethren.
And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.
And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.
For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that
is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.
And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,
Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,
Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.
And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom
is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;
And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.
And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.
And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask
counsel
 for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in,
both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.
And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:
And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.


### Numbers Chapter 28

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering,
and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire,
for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.
And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day,
for a continual burnt offering.
The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;
And a tenth
part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth
part of an hin of beaten oil.
It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.
And the drink offering thereof
shall be the fourth
part
 of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy
place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD
for a drink offering.
And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer
it,
 a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour
for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:
This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.
And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;
And three tenth deals of flour
for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour
for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;
And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil
for a meat offering unto one lamb;
for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.
And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third
part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth
part
 of an hin unto a lamb: this
is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.
And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.
And in the fourteenth day of the first month
is the passover of the LORD.
And in the fifteenth day of this month
is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
In the first day
shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work
therein:
But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire
for a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish:
And their meat offering
shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram;
A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs:
And one goat
for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.
Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which
is for a continual burnt offering.
After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.
And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.
Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your weeks
be out, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:
But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year;
And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,
A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs;
And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.
Ye shall offer
them beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish) and their drink offerings.


### Numbers Chapter 29

And in the seventh month, on the first
day of the month, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you.
And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; one young bullock, one ram,
and seven lambs of the first year without blemish:
And their meat offering
shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals for a bullock,
and two tenth deals for a ram,
And one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:
And one kid of the goats
for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you:
Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering, and the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering, and their drink offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.
And ye shall have on the tenth
day of this seventh month an holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall not do any work
therein:
But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD
for a sweet savour; one young bullock, one ram,
and seven lambs of the first year; they shall be unto you without blemish:
And their meat offering
shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals to a bullock,
and two tenth deals to one ram,
A several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts, beside your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings, and for your meat offerings, and for your drink offerings, and for your peace offerings.
And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.


### Numbers Chapter 30

And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded.
If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.
If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind
herself
 by a bond,
being in her father’s house in her youth;
And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;
And her husband heard
it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard
it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard
it;
 then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.
But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.
And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;
And her husband heard
it, and held his peace at her,
and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard
them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.
Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which
are
 upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard
them.
But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard
them; then he shall bear her iniquity.
These
are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter,
being yet in her youth in her father’s house.

### Numbers Chapter 31

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.
Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.
So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of
every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of
every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.
And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.
And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain;
namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
And the children of Israel took
all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.
And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.
And they took all the spoil, and all the prey,
both of men and of beasts.
And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which
are by Jordan
near
 Jericho.
And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host,
with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.
And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.
Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify
both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.
And purify all
your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats’
hair, and all things made of wood.
And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;
Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make
it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water.
And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Take the sum of the prey that was taken,
both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:
And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:
And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred,
both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:
Take
it of their half, and give
it unto Eleazar the priest,
for an heave offering of the LORD.
And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.
And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
And the booty,
being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,
And threescore and one thousand asses,
And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.
And the half,
which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:
And the LORD’S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.
And the beeves
were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD’S tribute
was threescore and twelve.
And the asses
were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD’S tribute
was threescore and one.
And the persons
were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD’S tribute
was thirty and two persons.
And Moses gave the tribute,
which was the LORD’S heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.
And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,
(Now the half
that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand
and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
And thirty and six thousand beeves,
And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,
And sixteen thousand persons;)
Even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one portion of fifty,
both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
And the officers which
were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:
And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which
are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.
We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.
And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them,
even
 all wrought jewels.
And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
(For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation,
for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.

## Deuteronomy

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** The book of Deuteronomy is set on the plains of Moab immediately before Israel's entry into Canaan, presenting Moses' final addresses to the wilderness generation's children. The internal chronology places these speeches in the 40th year after the Exodus (1:3), traditionally dated ca. 1406 BCE (early chronology) or 1250 BCE (late chronology). However, the book's composition date constitutes one of the most debated issues in biblical scholarship. Traditional Jewish and Christian interpretation attributes authorship to Moses (though chapter 34 describing Moses' death must be later addition). Critical scholarship proposes much later composition, with many scholars linking Deuteronomy to the "book of the law" discovered during Josiah's temple renovation (622 BCE, 2 Kings 22-23), suggesting the core was composed in the 7th century BCE to support Josiah's religious reforms (centralization of worship in Jerusalem, elimination of high places). This "Deuteronomistic" theology then shaped the subsequent historical books (Joshua-Kings). Others propose even later composition during Babylonian exile. The book's treaty structure paralleling ancient Near Eastern vassal treaties (particularly Hittite and Assyrian treaties from 14th-7th centuries BCE) complicates dating—some argue 2nd millennium parallels support Mosaic-era composition; others note Neo-Assyrian treaty influence suggesting 7th-century composition. The book likely incorporates earlier traditions shaped by later editors addressing contemporary concerns.

**Author and Audience:** Traditional Mosaic authorship faces challenges: the book refers to Moses in third person, describes his death and burial (chapter 34), includes phrases suggesting later perspective ("beyond the Jordan" assumes western Canaan viewpoint—3:8; "to this day"—3:14; 34:6), and shows linguistic/theological features characteristic of later Hebrew. Critical scholarship identifies Deuteronomistic authors/editors, likely Levitical priests or scribes associated with Jerusalem, composing/compiling the book during the late monarchic or exilic period. The covenant treaty structure, emphasis on exclusive Yahweh worship, centralization of worship at "the place the LORD will choose" (clear reference to Jerusalem temple though never named), and warnings against Canaanite religious influences reflect concerns of Josiah's reform movement or exilic community. The intended audience would be Judeans facing either religious reform under Josiah or exile in Babylon. For Josiah's generation, Deuteronomy validated centralized Jerusalem worship and exclusive Yahwism against syncretistic high places. For exilic Jews, the book explained why exile occurred (covenant disobedience) while maintaining hope for restoration through repentance and renewed covenant faithfulness. The sermonic, repetitive style ("Hear, O Israel"; "love the LORD your God with all your heart") addresses a community needing to internalize covenant obligations through repeated instruction—appropriate for either reform or exile context.

**Key Themes:** Covenant relationship forms Deuteronomy's central theme, structured as ancient Near Eastern treaty between divine sovereign (Yahweh) and vassal people (Israel). The Shema (6:4-5: "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength") encapsulates exclusive monotheistic devotion. Centralization of worship at Jerusalem appears throughout ("the place the LORD your God will choose")—one sanctuary for one God, eliminating competing altars and high places where syncretism flourished. The theme of covenant blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience structures the book (chapters 27-28), presenting Israel's future as determined by covenant faithfulness—life and prosperity in the land versus death and exile. Moses as covenant mediator appears prominently—Israel receives law not directly from terrifying Sinai theophany but through Moses' mediation, establishing prophetic authority ("The LORD will raise up for you a prophet like me"—18:15). The land as covenant gift requiring covenant faithfulness permeates the book—possession depends on obedience, making land tenure conditional rather than unconditional. The book emphasizes heart religion over mere external compliance—circumcision of heart (10:16; 30:6), loving God rather than just obeying, passing faith to next generation through teaching (6:6-9). Social justice receives extensive treatment—care for widow, orphan, stranger, reflecting God's character and Israel's own experience as oppressed strangers in Egypt. Memory and remembrance appear as theological imperatives—"remember" occurs dozens of times, calling Israel to remember Egypt, wilderness, God's mighty acts, and covenant obligations.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Archaeological evidence illuminates Deuteronomy's historical context and composition. The book's treaty structure parallels ancient Near Eastern vassal treaties, particularly Neo-Assyrian treaties from Esarhaddon's reign (7th century BCE), which show striking structural similarities: preamble, historical prologue, stipulations, blessings and curses, witnesses. These parallels suggest either early composition influenced by 2nd millennium Hittite treaties or 7th-century composition influenced by Neo-Assyrian treaties dominating that period. The centralization of worship at "the place the LORD will choose" aligns precisely with Josiah's reforms (622 BCE) described in 2 Kings 22-23, when Jerusalem temple became exclusive legitimate sanctuary and regional high places were destroyed—archaeological evidence shows cult site destruction at Arad, Beersheba, and other locations during this period. The Ketef Hinnom silver scrolls (late 7th-early 6th century BCE) contain the priestly blessing from Numbers 6:24-26, confirming that at least portions of Pentateuchal traditions existed in written form by this period. Deuteronomy's social justice laws—prohibition of moving boundary stones (19:14), accurate weights and measures (25:13-16), leaving gleanings for poor (24:19-22)—reflect agricultural society concerns matching Iron Age Judah. The cities of refuge mentioned (chapter 19) align with cities known from archaeological record. Deuteronomy's warnings against Canaanite religious practices (Asherah poles, sacred stones, child sacrifice) match practices evidenced archaeologically in Iron Age Levantine cult sites. The book's concern with covenant loyalty amid religious pluralism reflects historical challenges Judah faced during the 8th-7th centuries BCE when Assyrian domination brought cultural and religious pressures.

**Structure:** The book contains 34 chapters organized following ancient Near Eastern treaty structure: (1) Preamble and historical prologue (chapters 1-4): Moses recounts the wilderness journey, establishing covenant context; (2) General stipulations (chapters 5-11): Ten Commandments restated, Shema and call to exclusive covenant loyalty, warnings against Canaanite influences, promises of conquest; (3) Specific stipulations (chapters 12-26): detailed covenant laws covering worship centralization, dietary laws, festivals, civil/criminal justice, kingship regulations, warfare, family life, social justice; (4) Covenant ceremony instructions and blessings/curses (chapters 27-30): Shechem covenant renewal ritual, extensive blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience, call to choose life; (5) Succession and Moses' death (chapters 31-34): Joshua commissioned as Moses' successor, song of Moses, Moses' blessing on tribes, Moses views promised land from Pisgah, Moses dies and is buried. The structure parallels Hittite/Assyrian treaties remarkably: preamble identifying parties, historical prologue establishing relationship, stipulations (general then specific), blessings and curses, witnesses (heaven and earth invoked), succession provisions. This treaty structure presents covenant as binding legal relationship requiring exclusive loyalty and obedience. The sermonic style features repetitive exhortation and motivation—laws aren't merely stated but explained with theological rationale. The three addresses of Moses (1:6-4:40; 4:44-28:68; 29:1-30:20) structure the main content. The book functions both as Moses' farewell testimony and as foundational covenant document, ending Torah with Israel poised to enter promised land, Moses dying without entering—Israel's possession of land depends entirely on covenant faithfulness to the statutes Moses delivered. The Deuteronomistic History (Joshua-Kings) will demonstrate this theology: obedience brings blessing, disobedience brings curse, culminating in exile as ultimate covenant curse.

### Deuteronomy Chapter 19

When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;
Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.
Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.
And this
is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;
As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:
Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he
was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.
And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers;
If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three:
That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
for an inheritance, and
so blood be upon thee.
But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities:
Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.
Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away
the guilt of
 innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.
Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour’s landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.
One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.
If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him
that which is wrong;
Then both the men, between whom the controversy
is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days;
And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold,
if
 the witness
be a false witness,
and hath testified falsely against his brother;
Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.
And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.
And thine eye shall not pity;
but life
shall go
 for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.


### Deuteronomy Chapter 20

When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots,
and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God
is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,
And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;
For the LORD your God
is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.
And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man
is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.
And what man
is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not
yet eaten of it? let him
also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.
And what man
is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.
And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man
is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren’s heart faint as well as his heart.
And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.
When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.
And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be,
that all the people
that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.
And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:
And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:
But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city,
even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.
Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities
which are very far off from thee, which
are not of the cities of these nations.
But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee
for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:
But thou shalt utterly destroy them;
namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:
That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God.
When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field
is man’s
life) to employ
them
 in the siege:
Only the trees which thou knowest that they
be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.

### Deuteronomy Chapter 21

If
one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field,
and it be not known who hath slain him:
Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which
are round about him that is slain:
And it shall be,
that the city
which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with,
and which hath not drawn in the yoke;
And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer’s neck there in the valley:
And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be
tried:
And all the elders of that city,
that are next unto the slain
man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:
And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen
it.
Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel’s charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.
So shalt thou put away the
guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do
that which is right in the sight of the LORD.
When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive,
And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;
Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;
And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.
And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.
If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children,
both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:
Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit
that
 which he hath,
that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated,
which is indeed the firstborn:
But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated
for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he
is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn
is his.
If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and
that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:
Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;
And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son
is
 stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice;
he is
 a glutton, and a drunkard.
And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:
His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged
is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
for
 an inheritance.


### Deuteronomy Chapter 22

Thou shalt not see the brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother.
And if thy brother
be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.
In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost things of thy brother’s, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.
Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift
them
 up again.
The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment: for all that do so
are abomination unto the LORD thy God.
If a bird’s nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground,
whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:
But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and
that thou mayest prolong
thy days.
When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence.
Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled.
Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.
Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts,
as of woollen and linen together.
Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest
thyself.If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,
And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid:
Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth
the tokens of the damsel’s virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate:
And the damsel’s father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;
And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech
against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these
are the tokens of
 my daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;
And they shall amerce him in an hundred
shekels of silver, and give
them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
But if this thing be true,
and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:
Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father’s house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.
If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die,
both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.
If a damsel
that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;
Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not,
being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour’s wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.
But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die:
But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing;
there is in the damsel no sin
worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so
is this matter:
For he found her in the field,
and the betrothed damsel cried, and
there was none to save her.
If a man find a damsel
that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;
Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel’s father fifty
shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.
A man shall not take his father’s wife, nor discover his father’s skirt.


### Deuteronomy Chapter 23

He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.
A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD.
An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:
Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.
Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee.
Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.
Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he
is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land.
The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation.
When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing.
If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:
But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash
himself
 with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp
again.Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:
And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:
For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.
Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee:
He shall dwell with thee,
even among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him.
There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel.
Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even both these
are
 abomination unto the LORD thy God.
Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:
Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.
But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.
That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform;
even a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.
When thou comest into thy neighbour’s vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put
any
 in thy vessel.
When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour’s standing corn.


### Deuteronomy Chapter 24

When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give
it in her hand, and send her out of his house.
And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man’s
wife.
And
if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth
it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to
be his wife;
Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that
is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
for an inheritance.
When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business:
but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.
No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh
a man’s life to pledge.
If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.
Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.
Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.
When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.
Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.
And if the man
be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:
In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.
Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant
that is poor and needy,
whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that
are in thy land within thy gates:
At his day thou shalt give
him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he
is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee.
The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger,
nor
 of the fatherless; nor take a widow’s raiment to pledge:
But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.
When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.
When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean
it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.


### Deuteronomy Chapter 25

If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that
the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.
And it shall be, if the wicked man
be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.
Forty stripes he may give him,
and not exceed: lest,
if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.
Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out
the corn.
If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband’s brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband’s brother unto her.
And it shall be,
that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother
which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel.
And if the man like not to take his brother’s wife, then let his brother’s wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband’s brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband’s brother.
Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and
if he stand
to it, and say, I like not to take her;
Then shall his brother’s wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother’s house.
And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.
When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets:
Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity
her.
Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small.
Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small.
But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
For all that do such things,
and all that do unrighteously,
are an abomination unto the LORD thy God.
Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt;
How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee,
even
 all
that were feeble behind thee, when thou
wast
 faint and weary; and he feared not God.
Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee
for an inheritance to possess it,
that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget
it.

## Part 4: Conquest and Settlement

### Historical and Cultural Background: Conquest and Settlement

**Historical Context (Entry into Canaan (~1400-1050 BCE))**

The Conquest and Settlement period spans from Israel's entry into Canaan through the era of the Judges, traditionally dated ca. 1400-1050 BCE (early chronology) or 1230-1050 BCE (late chronology). This period corresponds archaeologically to the Late Bronze Age IIB and Iron Age I transitions. The historical reconstruction faces significant scholarly debate. The biblical account describes rapid military conquest under Joshua followed by gradual settlement and cyclical oppression/deliverance under judges. Archaeological evidence presents a more complex picture: widespread destructions at sites like Hazor, Lachish, and Bethel date to the 13th century BCE, but other conquest sites (Jericho, Ai) show occupation gaps or contradictory dating. The Merneptah Stele (ca. 1208 BCE) provides the earliest extra-biblical reference to "Israel" as a people group in Canaan. Scholars propose various models: military conquest (Albright), peaceful infiltration (Alt/Noth), peasant revolt (Mendenhall/Gottwald), or mixed processes. The premonarchic period shows gradual emergence of Israelite material culture in the central highlands, including four-room houses, collared-rim storage jars, and absence of pig bones—markers potentially indicating ethnic distinction from Canaanite populations.

**Geographic Setting**

The events center on the land of Canaan, roughly equivalent to modern Israel/Palestine, Lebanon, and western Jordan. The conquest narratives describe campaigns through three geographical zones: the central ridge route (Jericho, Ai, Shechem), the southern campaign (Hebron, Debir, Lachish), and the northern campaign (Hazor, Galilee). The Israelite settlement concentrated initially in the less-desirable hill country of Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin, and Judah—areas with thinner Canaanite settlement. The coastal plains, Jezreel Valley, and major Canaanite cities remained outside Israelite control. The Jordan River crossing at Gilgal (near Jericho) served as the initial base. Geography shaped military strategy: Canaanite chariot forces dominated valleys and plains (Judges 1:19), while Israelite fighters utilized hill country terrain advantages. The period saw establishment of tribal territorial boundaries, though the boundaries described in Joshua reflect idealized rather than fully realized control. Trade routes connecting Egypt with Mesopotamia (Via Maris) and Arabia with Damascus (King's Highway) passed through the region, making it strategically valuable but contested.

**Cultural Context**

Late Bronze Age Canaan exhibited a cosmopolitan urban culture influenced by Egyptian administration, though Egyptian control weakened substantially after 1200 BCE. Canaanite city-states featured fortified urban centers with palaces and temples, surrounded by agricultural hinterlands. The collapse of Bronze Age urban culture and shift to Iron Age village-based settlement marks this transitional period. Early Israelite settlements show distinctive features: small, unfortified villages (50-100 inhabitants) in previously sparsely settled hill country, terraced agriculture, cistern technology enabling settlement away from perennial springs, and egalitarian household structures without evident wealth disparities. Family structure centered on the bêt 'āb (father's house), with extended families forming protective clans (mišpāḥāh) and tribes (šēbeṭ). The period's cyclical oppression-deliverance pattern reflects the absence of centralized authority. Judges served as local charismatic military leaders rather than permanent rulers. Cultural practices included prohibition of intermarriage with Canaanites, dietary restrictions, circumcision, and covenant renewal ceremonies (Joshua 24). The book of Ruth provides insight into harvest customs, gleaning rights, and levirate marriage practices.

**Political Context**

The political landscape reflects the collapse of the Late Bronze Age international system. Egyptian hegemony over Canaan, established during the New Kingdom (18th-19th Dynasties), deteriorated after Ramesses III (ca. 1186-1155 BCE). The Hittite Empire collapsed ca. 1200 BCE, creating a power vacuum. Canaanite city-states, previously Egyptian vassals, operated independently without strong central authority—the Amarna Letters (14th century BCE) reveal their competitive, fractious relationships. The arrival of Sea Peoples along the coast (Philistines in the southern coastal plain) created a new threat reflected especially in the Samson narratives. Israelite political organization remained tribal and decentralized. The repeated refrain "there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (Judges 17:6, 21:25) characterizes this anarchic period. Leadership arose situationally: judges like Deborah, Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson emerged during crises, but their authority remained regional and temporary. Some judges (Gideon) explicitly rejected kingship offers. The oppressing powers mentioned—Mesopotamia (Judges 3), Moabites, Ammonites, Midianites, Philistines—reflect surrounding nations exploiting Israel's disunity. The period's end sees increasing calls for monarchical government.

**Economic Context**

The economy transitioned from Late Bronze Age urban-agricultural systems to Iron Age I highland subsistence farming. Early Israelite settlements depended on dry farming (wheat, barley), viticulture, and olive cultivation in terraced hillsides. Innovations like lime-plastered cisterns allowed year-round habitation away from springs, enabling expansion into previously marginal lands. Animal husbandry (sheep, goats) supplemented agriculture. Economic activity remained primarily local and subsistence-level, without the specialized production and long-distance trade characteristic of Canaanite city-states. The absence of centralized authority meant no formal taxation system, though periodic oppression by foreign powers required tribute payments. Archaeological evidence suggests relatively egalitarian distribution of resources in early Iron Age villages, without the wealth stratification visible in Late Bronze Age urban sites. The introduction of iron technology (name of the period) gradually revolutionized agriculture and warfare, though bronze remained common. Judges mentions Canaanite monopoly on iron technology (Judges 1:19 references iron chariots). Israelite control of inland trade routes developed gradually. The Philistines controlled the coastal Via Maris, limiting Israelite participation in Mediterranean commerce.

**Religious Context**

Religious practice during this period centers on covenant relationship with Yahweh, though syncretism with Canaanite religion posed persistent challenges. The conquest narratives emphasize herem (devoted destruction) of Canaanite religious sites and population, though archaeological evidence suggests cultural continuity. The central religious institution was the Tabernacle, located successively at Gilgal, Shiloh (primary location), and other sites. The ark of the covenant served as Yahweh's throne and focal point for worship. Annual pilgrimage festivals (Passover, Weeks, Tabernacles) maintained tribal unity. The Levitical priesthood, led by descendants of Aaron, conducted sacrificial worship. However, the period saw repeated apostasy: worship of Canaanite deities (Baal, Asherah, Ashtoreth) appears throughout Judges. The theological interpretation presents this apostasy as triggering foreign oppression, while repentance and return to Yahweh brings deliverance through judges. This deuteronomistic theology emphasizes exclusive Yahweh worship as prerequisite for blessing. Sites like Dan and Bethel appear as regional worship centers, sometimes problematically (Judges 17-18). Prophetic voices (Deborah as prophetess) provided divine guidance. The period lacks centralized religious control, mirroring political decentralization. The priestly blessing, Aaronic blessing, and covenant renewal ceremonies (Joshua 8:30-35, 24:1-28) reinforced covenantal identity amidst cultural pressures toward assimilation.

## Joshua

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** The book of Joshua describes events traditionally dated to ca. 1406-1390 BCE (early chronology based on 1 Kings 6:1) or ca. 1230-1200 BCE (late chronology based on archaeological destruction layers). Critical scholarship generally dates the book's composition much later, during the Deuteronomistic History compilation (7th-6th centuries BCE), though incorporating earlier traditions. The events described correspond to the Late Bronze Age II/Iron Age I transition, a period of significant upheaval throughout the eastern Mediterranean. The archaeological debate over the conquest remains contentious: sites like Hazor show 13th-century destruction layers consistent with conquest accounts, while Jericho and Ai present chronological problems (Jericho's Late Bronze walls had eroded; Ai was unoccupied). Modern scholarship proposes various models beyond simple military conquest, including gradual infiltration, internal revolt, or peaceful settlement processes.

**Author and Audience:** Traditional Jewish and Christian interpretation attributes authorship to Joshua himself or his contemporary (Talmud suggests Joshua wrote most, with later additions). The text refers to Joshua in third person, suggesting later compilation. Critical scholarship identifies the book as part of the Deuteronomistic History (Joshua-2 Kings), composed/edited during Josiah's reign (late 7th century BCE) or Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) to explain Israel's history from Moses to exile. Linguistic and theological features align with Deuteronomistic editing. The intended audience would be exilic or post-exilic Jews seeking to understand their covenant relationship with Yahweh, land promises, and reasons for exile. The book's emphasis on complete conquest and herem (devoted destruction) reflects theological ideals rather than necessarily complete historical reportage—Judges 1 acknowledges significant Canaanite populations remained.

**Key Themes:** The book develops several major theological themes: fulfillment of divine promises (land promised to Abraham now possessed), Yahweh as divine warrior fighting for Israel, the necessity of covenant obedience (victory requires faithfulness; Achan's sin brings defeat), complete devotion to Yahweh requiring elimination of competing religious influences (herem theology), leadership transition from Moses to Joshua, importance of Torah observance (Joshua 1:7-8), covenant renewal and commitment (Joshua 24), and tribal inheritance of land portions. The conquest functions theologically as holy war with Yahweh directing strategy and granting victory. The Rahab and Gibeonite episodes introduce themes of faith transcending ethnicity. The eastern tribes' altar (chapter 22) addresses worship centralization. The book presents conquest as paradigm for trusting divine promises and obeying covenant stipulations.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Archaeological evidence provides complex testimony regarding the conquest narratives. Hazor (Tell el-Qedah) shows destruction ca. 1230 BCE, consistent with Joshua 11. Lachish (Tell ed-Duweir) has a destruction layer ca. 1200 BCE. Bethel shows Late Bronze destruction. However, Jericho (Tell es-Sultan) lacks clear Late Bronze Age fortifications or destruction layer from the relevant period—Kathleen Kenyon's excavations found earlier (Middle Bronze) walls but Late Bronze occupation was minimal. Ai (et-Tell) was unoccupied during the Late Bronze Age, destroyed centuries earlier. These discrepancies fuel scholarly debate about the conquest's historicity and nature. The Merneptah Stele (1208 BCE) provides the earliest extra-biblical reference to "Israel" as a people in Canaan. Settlement surveys in the central hill country reveal a dramatic population increase in Iron Age I (ca. 1200-1000 BCE), with small unwalled villages appearing in previously lightly settled regions—this pattern supports gradual settlement models. The four-room house architecture, collared-rim jars, and absence of pig bones in these sites suggest emerging Israelite material culture distinct from Canaanite coastal cities.

**Structure:** The book contains 24 chapters organized in three major sections: (1) Conquest of the land (chapters 1-12): preparation and crossing the Jordan, Jericho and central campaign, southern and northern campaigns, summary of defeated kings; (2) Distribution of the land (chapters 13-21): tribal allotments, inheritance boundaries, Levitical cities, cities of refuge; (3) Covenant renewal and farewell (chapters 22-24): eastern tribes' altar controversy, Joshua's farewell addresses, Shechem covenant ceremony. The structure moves from military action through administrative land division to covenant ceremony, emphasizing both physical conquest and spiritual commitment. The geographical precision in tribal boundary descriptions (chapters 13-21) reflects administrative concerns, whether from Joshua's era or later periods. The book concludes with Joshua's death and burial, paralleling the Pentateuch's conclusion with Moses' death, marking leadership transition and end of the conquest generation.

          This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families;
even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward
was the uttermost part of the south coast.
And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:
And it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:
From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.
And the east border
was the salt sea,
even unto the end of Jordan. And
their border in the north quarter
was
 from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:
And the border went up to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:
And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal,
that is before the going up to Adummim, which
is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel:
And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same
is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that
lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which
is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:
And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which
is Kirjath-jearim:
And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which
is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed on to Timnah:
And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.
And the west border
was to the great sea, and the coast
thereof. This
is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.
And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua,
even
 the city of Arba the father of Anak, which
city is Hebron.
And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before
was Kirjath-sepher.
And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
And it came to pass, as she came
unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off
her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?
Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.
This
is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.
And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,
And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,
And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,
Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,

And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,
And Gederoth, Beth-dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages:
Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,
And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,
And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages:
Ekron, with her towns and her villages:
From Ekron even unto the sea, all that
lay near Ashdod, with their villages:
Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border
thereof:And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,
And Dannah, and Kirjath-sannah, which
is Debir,
And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,
And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages:
Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,
And Janum, and Beth-tappuah, and Aphekah,

In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah,
And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages.
As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.

### Joshua Chapter 16

And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,
And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth,
And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gezer: and the goings out thereof are at the sea.
So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was
thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper;
And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;
And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.
The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This
is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.
And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim
were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute.


### Joshua Chapter 17

There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he
was
 the firstborn of Joseph;
to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
There was also
a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these
were
 the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.
But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these
are
 the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.
And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which
were on the other side Jordan;
Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land of Gilead.
And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
lieth
 before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh
belonged to the children of Ephraim;
And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim
are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also
was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:
Southward
it was Ephraim’s, and northward
it was
 Manasseh’s, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.
And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns,
even three countries.
Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out
the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out.
And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me
but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I
am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?
And Joshua answered them, If thou
be a great people,
then get thee up to the wood
country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.
And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron,
both they who
are of Beth-shean and her towns, and
they who
are of the valley of Jezreel.
And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph,
even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou
art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot
only:
But the mountain shall be thine; for it
is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots,
and though they
be strong.


### Joshua Chapter 18

And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.
And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.
And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long
are
 ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?
Give out from among you three men for
each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come
again
 to me.
And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north.
Ye shall therefore describe the land
into seven parts, and bring
the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.
And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.
And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came
again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.
And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.
And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that
lieth on the south side of the nether Beth-horon.
And the border was drawn
thence, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that
lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath-baal, which
is
 Kirjath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this
was
 the west quarter.
And the south quarter
was from the end of Kirjath-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:
And the border came down to the end of the mountain that
lieth
 before the valley of the son of Hinnom,
and which
is
 in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel,
And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which
is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,
And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah:
And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this
was the south coast.
And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This
was
 the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families.
Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz,
And Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,
And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
And Chephar-haammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages:
Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,
And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,
And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,
And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which
is Jerusalem, Gibeath,
and Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This
is
 the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.


### Joshua Chapter 19

And the second lot came forth to Simeon,
even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.
And they had in their inheritance Beer-sheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,
And Hazar-shual, and Balah, and Azem,
And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,
And Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah,
And Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their villages:
Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages:
And all the villages that
were round about these cities to Baalath-beer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.
Out of the portion of the children of Judah
was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.
And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:
And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that
is before Jokneam;
And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chisloth-tabor, and then goeth out to daberath, and goeth up to Japhia,
And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittah-hepher, to Ittah-kazin, and goeth out to Remmon-methoar to Neah;
And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon: and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthah-el:
And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.
This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.
          And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of Issachar according to their families.
And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,
And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath,
And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,
And Remeth, and En-gannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez;
And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Beth-shemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.
And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.
And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,
And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel westward, and to Shihor-libnath;
And turneth toward the sunrising to Beth-dagon, and reacheth to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthah-el toward the north side of Beth-emek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand,
And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah,
even unto great Zidon;
And
then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:
Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.
This
is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali,
even
 for the children of Naphtali according to their families.
And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan:
And
then the coast turneth westward to Aznoth-tabor, and goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.
And the fenced cities
are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,
And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,
And Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor,
And Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.
This
is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.
          And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.
And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh,
And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,
And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,
And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,
And Jehud, and Bene-berak, and Gath-rimmon,
And Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.
And the coast of the children of Dan went out
too little
 for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.
This
is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:
According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked,
even Timnath-serah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein.
These
are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.


### Joshua Chapter 20

The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses:
That the slayer that killeth
any person unawares
and
 unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.
And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment,
and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.
And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjath-arba, which
is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.
And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth
any
 person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.

### Joshua Chapter 21

Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;
And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.
And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs.
And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest,
which were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
And the rest of the children of Kohath
had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
And the children of Gershon
had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
The children of Merari by their families
had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are
here mentioned by name,
Which the children of Aaron,
being of the families of the Kohathites,
who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the first lot.
And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which
city is Hebron, in the hill
country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it.
But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs,
to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs,
And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,
And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,
And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs,
and
 Beth-shemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.
And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs,
Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities.
All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests,
were
 thirteen cities with their suburbs.
And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim,
to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs,
And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Beth-horon with her suburbs; four cities.
And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her suburbs,
Aijalon with her suburbs, Gath-rimmon with her suburbs; four cities.
And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with her suburbs; two cities.
All the cities
were ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that remained.
And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the
other half tribe of Manasseh
they gave Golan in Bashan with her suburbs,
to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Beesh-terah with her suburbs; two cities.
And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs, Dabareh with her suburbs,
Jarmuth with her suburbs, En-gannim with her suburbs; four cities.
And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon with her suburbs,
Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four cities.
And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs,
to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammoth-dor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.
All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families
were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,
Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities.
And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah with her suburbs,
Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four cities.
And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs,
to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs,
Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in all.
So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities.
All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel
were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.
These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus
were all these cities.
And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.
And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.
There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.

## Judges

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** The book of Judges describes the period between Joshua's death and the establishment of the monarchy, traditionally ca. 1390-1050 BCE (early chronology) or 1200-1050 BCE (late chronology). The events correspond to Iron Age I archaeologically. However, the chronological data within Judges presents challenges: if the oppression and judgeship periods are sequential, they total approximately 410 years, conflicting with other biblical chronologies (1 Kings 6:1 suggests only 480 years from Exodus to Solomon's temple, leaving insufficient time). This suggests either overlapping judgeships (some judges ruled concurrently in different regions) or schematic/symbolic numbers. Critical scholarship dates the book's composition to the Deuteronomistic History period (7th-6th centuries BCE), though incorporating earlier oral traditions and possibly written sources like the "Book of the Wars of the LORD" (Numbers 21:14). The editorial framework with its cyclical pattern (apostasy-oppression-repentance-deliverance) reflects Deuteronomistic theology explaining Israel's pre-monarchic struggles.

**Author and Audience:** Traditional attribution suggests Samuel as author (Talmud: Baba Bathra 14b), though this lacks explicit biblical support. The repeated phrase "in those days there was no king in Israel" (17:6, 18:1, 19:1, 21:25) indicates composition during the monarchic period, likely reflecting pro-monarchical perspective that views the judges period's anarchy as justifying kingship. Critical scholarship identifies Deuteronomistic editing, with the book compiled/edited during Josiah's reign or Babylonian exile alongside Joshua, Samuel, and Kings. The framework passages (2:6-3:6, transitional formulas) show Deuteronomistic style, while the individual judge narratives preserve older traditions with diverse literary styles. The intended audience would be Israelites during or after monarchy, seeking to understand their covenant history and the consequences of covenant unfaithfulness. The negative portrayal of this period (moral decline, religious syncretism, social chaos) serves to validate monarchical government while warning that even kings must obey covenant stipulations.

**Key Themes:** The book develops a cyclical theological pattern repeated throughout: Israel serves Yahweh → apostasy and worship of Canaanite deities (Baal, Asherah) → Yahweh's anger brings foreign oppression → Israel cries out → Yahweh raises up a deliverer/judge → peace is restored → the cycle repeats. This deuteronomistic framework emphasizes covenant theology: faithfulness brings blessing, unfaithfulness brings judgment. Other major themes include the dangers of incomplete conquest leaving Canaanite religious influences, the necessity of exclusive Yahweh worship, the failure of human leadership without divine guidance, increasing moral degeneration throughout the period (compare Othniel's righteousness to Samson's compromise), tribal disunity and internal conflict, and the inadequacy of charismatic leadership without centralized authority. The book's conclusion (chapters 17-21) presents horrific accounts of religious apostasy and civil war, illustrating the chaos described in "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (21:25). The judges themselves often display moral ambiguity (Gideon's ephod, Jephthah's vow, Samson's personal vendettas), showing human inadequacy and need for divine deliverance.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Archaeological evidence from Iron Age I illuminates the Judges period's social context. The settlement pattern shows proliferation of small, unwalled villages in the central hill country (Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin, Judah) during 1200-1000 BCE, consistent with early Israelite settlement. These sites show the distinctive four-room house architecture, collared-rim storage jars, and absence of pig bones that characterize emerging Israelite material culture. Excavations at Dan (Tel Dan) reveal cult site establishment, related to Judges 17-18 narratives. Philistine settlement along the southern coast dates to ca. 1175 BCE (Aegean-style pottery at Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, Gath), confirming the Philistine presence prominent in Judges (especially Samson narratives). Iron technology introduction, mentioned regarding Philistine military advantage (Judges 1:19 iron chariots), characterizes this period's beginning. Hazor's destruction layer (ca. 1230 BCE) may relate to Judges 4-5 (though dating debates continue). The lack of centralized Israelite political authority reflected in Judges aligns with archaeological evidence showing no major Israelite urban centers or monumental architecture during this period—settlement remained village-based and decentralized until monarchy emergence.

**Structure:** The book contains 21 chapters with a clear structural framework: (1) Introduction (1:1-3:6): incomplete conquest, theological framework explaining the judges cycle, testing of Israel; (2) The Judges cycles (3:7-16:31): twelve judges (six "major" with detailed narratives—Othniel, Ehud, Deborah/Barak, Gideon, Jephthah, Samson; six "minor" with brief notices—Shamgar, Tola, Jair, Ibzan, Elon, Abdon); (3) Appendices showing moral decline (17:1-21:25): Micah's idolatry and the Danite migration, the Levite's concubine and civil war against Benjamin. The narrative structure shows progressive degeneration: early judges like Othniel appear relatively righteous, while later judges display increasing compromise. The cycles themselves show deterioration—deliverance becomes less complete, peace periods shorten, judges display more personal failings. Deborah's song (chapter 5) represents some of the Bible's oldest poetry, likely contemporary with events described. The appendices lack the cyclical framework, instead illustrating the period's chaos with the repeated refrain about absence of kingship, building a case for monarchical authority.

### Judges Chapter 21

Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.
And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;
And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?
And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
And the children of Israel said, Who
is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?
And they said, What one
is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.
For the people were numbered, and, behold,
there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.
And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.
And this
is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.
And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
And the whole congregation sent
some to speak to the children of Benjamin that
were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.
And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.
And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
And they said,
There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.
Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed
be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.
Then they said, Behold,
there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly
in a place which
is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;
And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time,
that ye should be guilty.
And the children of Benjamin did so, and took
them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.
And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.
In those days
there was no king in Israel: every man did
that which was right in his own eyes.

## Ruth

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** The book of Ruth sets its narrative "in the days when the judges ruled" (1:1), placing events during the 12th-11th centuries BCE. However, the book's composition date differs from its setting. Linguistic features, including Aramaisms and the explanatory note about ancient customs (4:7), suggest post-exilic composition (5th-4th centuries BCE), though some scholars argue for earlier (monarchic period) dating. The genealogy concluding with David (4:17-22) indicates composition after David's reign but could be a later addition. The book's literary sophistication, nuanced characterization, and universalistic themes align with post-exilic concerns about community boundaries, treatment of foreigners, and defining authentic Israelite identity. The Persian period context saw debates about intermarriage with foreigners (Ezra-Nehemiah's exclusivism), and Ruth presents a counter-narrative celebrating a Moabite ancestor of David. The idyllic portrayal of judges-era social customs contrasts sharply with Judges' depiction of the same period, suggesting idealized retrospection.

**Author and Audience:** The book's author remains unknown. Traditional Jewish sources (Talmud) attribute authorship to Samuel, though the text's linguistic features contradict such early dating. The sophisticated Hebrew prose, careful literary structure, and nuanced theology suggest an educated author, possibly associated with wisdom circles given thematic connections to wisdom literature (providence, character development, proper conduct). The intended audience appears to be post-exilic Judean community wrestling with questions of ethnicity, inclusion, and covenant identity. The book's sympathetic portrayal of a Moabite woman who becomes David's great-grandmother challenges ethnic exclusivism. Ruth's declaration of loyalty (1:16-17) models ideal conversion and covenant commitment. The audience would appreciate the irony that David's lineage includes Moabite blood, precisely the ancestry Deuteronomy 23:3 problematically excludes. The book functions as a wisdom tale teaching about covenant loyalty (hesed), divine providence working through human faithfulness, and the blessings of righteousness transcending ethnic boundaries.

**Key Themes:** The book develops several interwoven themes. Covenant loyalty (hesed) appears repeatedly—Ruth's loyalty to Naomi, Boaz's kindness to Ruth, God's providence underlying events. Divine providence operates subtly through human actions and "coincidences" (Ruth "happened" to glean in Boaz's field, 2:3), reflecting theology where God works through ordinary circumstances rather than miraculous interventions. The redemption theme centers on the go'el (kinsman-redeemer) fulfilling family obligations to redeem land and provide offspring for the deceased. Boaz functions as redeemer, foreshadowing later redemption theology. The reversal of fortunes motif (emptiness to fullness, famine to harvest, bitterness to joy) structures the narrative: Naomi begins empty and bitter but concludes blessed with grandson and security. The book celebrates faith transcending ethnicity—Ruth the Moabite displays greater covenant loyalty than many Israelites in Judges. Wisdom themes include righteous character, proper social conduct, the blessings of integrity, and God's care for the vulnerable (widows, foreigners). The book's placement in Christian canon before 1 Samuel makes sense narratively, though Jewish canon places it among the Writings (Ketuvim), read at Shavuot (Pentecost/Weeks) celebrating harvest and Torah.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Archaeological evidence illuminates the book's Iron Age setting and post-exilic composition. The customs described—gleaning rights, sandal ceremony (4:7), levirate marriage extension to broader kinsmen, gate assemblies for legal proceedings—reflect ancient Israelite practices attested elsewhere. Bethlehem's archaeological record shows continuous occupation from Middle Bronze Age through Iron Age, though its small size (a village rather than fortified city) matches the book's portrayal. The "House of Bread" (Bethlehem's meaning) experiencing famine presents ironic contrast. Moabite material culture from Iron Age I-II (1200-600 BCE) shows close similarity to Israelite culture, with shared pottery forms, architecture, and agricultural practices. The Mesha Stele (9th century BCE) provides extra-biblical Moabite evidence, revealing religious and linguistic parallels with Hebrew. Ruth's Moabite identity would carry specific connotations: traditional enemies (Judges 3:12-30), culturally similar but theologically distinct (Chemosh worship), and subject to Deuteronomic exclusion. Post-exilic Judah saw emphasis on ethnic purity, making Ruth's celebration of Moabite inclusion counter-cultural. The book's literary perfection and universal themes suggest composition during a period of literary sophistication and theological reflection on Israel's identity and divine purposes.

**Structure:** The book contains four carefully crafted chapters forming a chiastic structure. Chapter 1 presents the problem: famine, death, emptiness—Naomi returns to Bethlehem bitter and empty, accompanied by loyal Ruth. Chapter 2 introduces the solution: Ruth meets Boaz, receives his kindness, and Naomi recognizes him as potential redeemer. Chapter 3 shows initiative: Naomi and Ruth execute a bold plan at the threshing floor, Boaz responds honorably, promising redemption. Chapter 4 resolves all tensions: Boaz legally redeems Ruth and Naomi's property, marries Ruth, and their son Obed becomes David's grandfather. The structure moves from death to life, famine to harvest, emptiness to fullness, foreign land to promised land, bitterness to joy. The narrative flows seamlessly with careful scene construction, dialogue-driven action, and character development. Harvest season provides the temporal framework (barley harvest through wheat harvest), symbolically paralleling the characters' journey from emptiness to fullness. The genealogy (4:18-22) connects Ruth to Israel's royal lineage, revealing the story's ultimate significance: this Moabite woman's faithfulness contributes to David's ancestry and, ultimately, to messianic lineage in Christian interpretation. The book functions as both historical narrative and wisdom tale, demonstrating covenant loyalty's blessings and God's providence working through faithful human action.

### Ruth Chapter 1

Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
And the name of the man
was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one
was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.
And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.
Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.
Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother’s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each
of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.
And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me?
are there yet
any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
Turn again, my daughters, go
your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope,
if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;
Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.
And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.
And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.
And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee,
or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people
shall be my people, and thy God my God:
Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also,
if ought but death part thee and me.
When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.
So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said,
Is this Naomi?
And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why
then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.


### Ruth Chapter 2

And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name
was Boaz.
And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after
him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field
belonging unto Boaz, who
was of the kindred of Elimelech.
And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD
be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.
Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel
is this?
And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It
is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:
And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.
Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:
Let thine eyes
be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of
that
 which the young men have drawn.
Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I
am a stranger?
And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and
how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.
The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.
Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.
And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched
corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.
And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:
And let fall also
some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave
them, that she may glean
them, and rebuke her not.
So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.
And she took
it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.
And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to day
is Boaz.
And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed
be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man
is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.
And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law,
It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.
So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.


### Ruth Chapter 3

Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
And now
is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.
Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor:
but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.
And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.
And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.
And he said, Who
art thou? And she answered, I
am
 Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou
art a near kinsman.
And he said, Blessed
be thou of the LORD, my daughter:
for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.
And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou
art
 a virtuous woman.
And now it is true that I
am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.
Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning,
that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman’s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee,
as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.
And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.
Also he said, Bring the vail that
thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six
measures of barley, and laid
it on her: and she went into the city.
And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who
art
 thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
And she said, These six
measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.
Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.


### Ruth Chapter 4

Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which
was our brother Elimelech’s:
And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy
it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem
it, redeem
it: but if thou wilt not redeem
it, then
 tell me, that I may know: for
there is none to redeem
it beside thee; and I
am after thee. And he said, I will redeem
it.
Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy
it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem
it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.
Now this
was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave
it to his neighbour: and this
was
 a testimony in Israel.
Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy
it for thee. So he drew off his shoe.
And Boaz said unto the elders, and
unto all the people, Ye
are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that
was
 Elimelech’s, and all that
was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.
Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye
are witnesses this day.
And all the people that
were in the gate, and the elders, said,
We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:
And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.
So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.
And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed
be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.
And he shall be unto thee a restorer of
thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.
And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.
And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he
is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
Now these
are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,
And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

## Part 5: United Monarchy

### Historical and Cultural Background: United Monarchy

**Historical Context (Saul, David, Solomon (~1050-930 BCE))**

The United Monarchy period encompasses the reigns of Israel's first three kings: Saul (ca. 1050-1010 BCE), David (ca. 1010-970 BCE), and Solomon (ca. 970-930 BCE). These dates follow traditional biblical chronology, though significant scholarly debate surrounds the historical reconstruction of this era. Archaeological evidence for the United Monarchy remains contested and has sparked the "minimalist-maximalist" debate. Traditional scholars (maximalists) accept the biblical account as substantially historical, pointing to the Tel Dan Stele (9th century BCE) mentioning the "House of David" as extra-biblical confirmation of the Davidic dynasty. Minimalist scholars argue that archaeological evidence for a substantial 10th-century kingdom is lacking, with monumental architecture once attributed to Solomon now redated by some to the 9th century (Omride dynasty). The period corresponds to Iron Age IIA, characterized by transition from village-based settlement to early state formation. This era coincided with a power vacuum in the ancient Near East: Egyptian New Kingdom decline, Assyrian withdrawal from the Levant, and Hittite Empire collapse created conditions allowing small Levantine states (Israel, Judah, Aram-Damascus, Ammon, Moab, Philistia) to emerge independently. The biblical portrayal presents this as Israel's golden age—territorial expansion, centralized government, temple construction, international trade, and cultural flourishing—though archaeological verification remains debated, particularly regarding the empire's extent and prosperity.

**Geographic Setting**

The United Monarchy's territory extended, according to biblical accounts, from "Dan to Beersheba" and even beyond—from the Euphrates River to Egypt's border, encompassing modern Israel, Palestinian territories, Jordan, southern Lebanon, and portions of Syria. The kingdom's core consisted of two geographical and cultural zones: Israel (northern tribes) centered in the fertile Jezreel Valley, Samarian hills, and Galilee; and Judah (southern tribe) in the more isolated and arid Judean highlands. Jerusalem, conquered by David from the Jebusites, became the political and religious capital situated on the border between Judah and Benjamin, strategically neutral ground between north and south. The capital's location on the central ridge route provided defensibility but limited water resources (Gihon Spring). Saul's capital at Gibeah (Tell el-Ful) was modest, while Solomon's building projects transformed Jerusalem substantially according to biblical accounts. The kingdom controlled vital trade routes: the coastal Via Maris connecting Egypt and Mesopotamia (though Philistine cities maintained independence), and the Transjordanian King's Highway connecting Arabia with Damascus. Solomon's expansion included Red Sea access through Ezion-geber (near modern Eilat/Aqaba), enabling maritime trade with Arabia, East Africa, and possibly India. The diverse geography—coastal plains, central hill country, Jordan valley, Transjordanian plateau, Negev desert—required different administrative approaches. The biblical account describes twelve administrative districts (1 Kings 4) replacing tribal boundaries, though their historical reality remains debated.

**Cultural Context**

The United Monarchy period saw dramatic cultural transformation from tribal confederation to centralized state. Urbanization accelerated: cities like Jerusalem, Megiddo, Hazor, and Gezer gained fortified walls, gates, palaces, and administrative buildings. The four-room house remained the standard domestic architecture, though elite compounds appeared. Literacy increased with state bureaucracy requiring scribes, tax collectors, and administrators. The biblical account describes Solomon's court with officials, provincial governors, military commanders, and a substantial harem reflecting royal polygamy for diplomatic alliances. Social stratification intensified: royal house, aristocracy, priesthood, military elite, merchants, artisans, farmers, and slaves formed distinct classes. The monarchy's demands—taxation, corvée labor (forced labor for building projects), military conscription—represented significant changes from judges-period autonomy. Northern tribes particularly resented these burdens, contributing to eventual kingdom division. Cultural exchange expanded through trade and diplomatic marriages: Solomon's marriage alliances with Egypt, Tyre, and other neighbors brought foreign influences. Phoenician craftsmen contributed to temple construction. Cultural practices included annual festivals at Jerusalem temple, pilgrimage obligations, sacrificial worship, royal patronage of musicians and wisdom literature. The transition from tribal kinship structures to monarchic hierarchical society created tensions reflected in prophetic criticism (Samuel's anti-monarchy warnings, Nathan's confrontation of David). Family life maintained patriarchal structures, with extended households (bêt 'āb) forming the basic social unit, though royal court life diverged substantially from peasant village culture.

**Political Context**

The United Monarchy emerged from Philistine pressure on Israel's tribal confederation. The Philistines, settled along the southern coast since ca. 1175 BCE, possessed military superiority including iron technology monopoly and organized army. The capture of the ark of the covenant (1 Samuel 4) and domination of Israelite territories prompted demands for monarchical leadership to "be like other nations" (1 Samuel 8). Saul's reign established the monarchy but remained transitional—a charismatic military leader more than institutionalized king. David's reign consolidated the kingdom through military conquests: defeating Philistines, Moabites, Edomites, Ammonites, and Arameans, establishing an empire reaching from Euphrates to Egypt according to biblical accounts (though archaeological verification is debated). David's administrative innovations included professional military (standing army with foreign mercenaries), central bureaucracy, and religious centralization with the ark in Jerusalem. The succession crisis involving Absalom's revolt and Adonijah's attempted coup reveals instability in establishing dynastic succession. Solomon's reign emphasized diplomacy over military expansion, with treaty marriages and trade agreements. His administrative reforms reorganizing twelve districts (1 Kings 4) replacing tribal boundaries strengthened centralization but alienated northern tribes. The forced labor imposed particularly on northern tribes (1 Kings 11:28) and heavy taxation created resentment. Solomon's tolerance of foreign wives' religious practices (1 Kings 11) and his own high places construction contradicted Yahwistic exclusivism. The political tensions between north and south, temporarily unified under David and Solomon, would explode upon Solomon's death when Rehoboam's harsh policies prompted northern secession (1 Kings 12).

**Economic Context**

The United Monarchy period witnessed economic transformation and, according to biblical accounts, unprecedented prosperity, though archaeological evidence for this remains debated. The economy diversified from primarily subsistence agriculture to include specialized production, international trade, and royal monopolies. Agriculture remained foundational: wheat, barley, grapes, olives, figs formed staple crops, supplemented by sheep and goat herding. The monarchy extracted agricultural surplus through taxation—1 Kings 4 describes Solomon's court consuming vast daily provisions. Royal estates (crown lands) and palace industries produced for export. Solomon's wealth, described extravagantly in 1 Kings 10, derived from multiple sources according to the biblical account: taxation of subjects, tribute from vassal states, control of trade routes with transit fees, commercial ventures with Phoenician partners (maritime trade from Ezion-geber), and trade in horses and chariots (1 Kings 10:28-29). The partnership with Hiram of Tyre provided Phoenician ships, sailors, and craftsmen in exchange for Israelite agricultural products and labor. Trade goods included: gold, silver, ivory, spices, incense, precious stones, timber (especially cedar from Lebanon), copper (from Arabah mines), and luxury items. Building projects required enormous resources: Jerusalem temple and palace complexes, fortification of Hazor, Megiddo, Gezer, and other cities. These projects demanded taxation, forced labor (conscripted workers), and raw materials procurement. Economic inequality increased substantially—the biblical text describes Solomon's splendor while noting the burdens on common people. Archaeological evidence shows increased social stratification in material culture: elite compounds versus simple houses, luxury goods versus basic pottery.

**Religious Context**

The United Monarchy period revolutionized Israelite religious practice through centralization of worship in Jerusalem. Before David, worship occurred at multiple locations—Shiloh, Bethel, Gilgal, and local high places—with the ark of the covenant as the mobile focal point. David's capture of Jerusalem and installation of the ark there initiated centralization, though full temple construction awaited Solomon. The Jerusalem temple, constructed with Phoenician assistance following Syro-Phoenician architectural models, became the exclusive legitimate sanctuary for Yahweh worship according to Deuteronomistic theology. The temple housed the ark in the Holy of Holies, included the Holy Place with golden lampstand, incense altar, and bread of Presence, and featured elaborate bronze work including massive pillars (Jachin and Boaz), bronze sea, and wheeled lavers. Sacrificial worship occurred at the large bronze altar in the temple courtyard. The Levitical priesthood, with Zadokite high priests, controlled temple worship. Three annual pilgrimage festivals (Passover, Weeks, Tabernacles) brought Israelites to Jerusalem, reinforcing political and religious unity. Royal ideology developed depicting the king as Yahweh's anointed (messiah), adopted son of God (Psalm 2:7), and covenant mediator. The Davidic Covenant (2 Samuel 7) promised eternal dynasty, providing theological foundation for messianic expectations. However, religious syncretism posed constant challenges. Solomon's foreign wives and their deities (Ashtoreth, Chemosh, Molech—1 Kings 11:5-8), his construction of high places for these deities, and popular participation in local shrines compromised exclusive Yahwism. The tension between official Jerusalem temple cult and popular religion with its household gods, local high places, and syncretic practices would continue throughout monarchy. Prophetic movement emerged during this period—Samuel, Nathan, Gad—exercising moral authority to challenge royal power, establishing the prophetic tradition of covenant enforcement.

## 1 Samuel

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** The book of 1 Samuel describes events from the late judges period through the early monarchy, approximately 1100-1010 BCE (late 12th through early 10th centuries). This corresponds archaeologically to Iron Age IIA. The events span from Samuel's birth through Saul's death, marking the crucial transition from tribal confederation to monarchical state. However, the book's composition date differs significantly from its setting. Critical scholarship identifies 1 Samuel (along with 2 Samuel, 1-2 Kings) as part of the Deuteronomistic History, compiled/edited during the late monarchic period (7th century BCE under Josiah) or Babylonian exile (6th century BCE). The book likely incorporates earlier sources: the "Ark Narrative" (chapters 4-6), "History of David's Rise" (chapters 16-2 Samuel 5), and possibly court records or prophetic traditions. Linguistic analysis reveals composite authorship with editorial layers. The historical reconstruction of this period faces challenges: archaeological evidence for Saul's reign is minimal (his capital Gibeah shows only modest settlement), while David's early career remains difficult to verify independently, though the Tel Dan Stele confirms the Davidic dynasty's existence by the 9th century BCE.

**Author and Audience:** Traditional Jewish and Christian attribution names Samuel as author (Talmud: Baba Bathra 14b-15a), though the text describes Samuel's death (25:1) and subsequent events, requiring later supplementation. The book's composition more likely reflects Deuteronomistic editing, compiling earlier traditions into theological history explaining monarchy's origins and eventual exile. Multiple sources appear integrated: pro-monarchical traditions (Israel needs a king to defend against enemies) and anti-monarchical traditions (kingship represents rejection of Yahweh's rule—see 8:7) coexist, suggesting compilation from diverse perspectives. The Deuteronomistic editors shaped these traditions to emphasize covenant theology: obedience brings blessing, disobedience brings judgment. The intended audience would be exilic or post-exilic Jews seeking to understand their history, the establishment of David's dynasty (theologically foundational despite exile), and the proper relationship between royal authority and divine sovereignty. The book validates Davidic legitimacy while critiquing monarchical failures, particularly Saul's disobedience serving as cautionary example that even divinely appointed kings must submit to prophetic authority and covenant requirements.

**Key Themes:** The book develops several interconnected theological themes. The transition from theocracy to monarchy forms the structural backbone: Israel's demand for "a king like the nations" (8:5) represents both pragmatic response to Philistine threat and theological crisis (rejection of Yahweh as king). The book presents monarchy ambivalently—necessary for survival yet dangerous for covenant faithfulness. Divine sovereignty over human institutions appears throughout: Yahweh chooses, anoints, and removes kings according to covenant obedience. The contrast between Saul and David illustrates this: Saul, chosen for external qualities (height, appearance), fails through disobedience (unauthorized sacrifice, incomplete herem against Amalekites); David, chosen for internal qualities ("heart"—16:7), succeeds despite moral failures because of repentance and covenant loyalty. Prophetic authority challenging royal power emerges prominently—Samuel confronts Saul repeatedly, establishing the prophetic tradition's independence from political power. The importance of obedience over ritual appears in Samuel's famous rebuke: "to obey is better than sacrifice" (15:22). The spirit of Yahweh empowering leaders (rushing upon Saul, anointing David) shows divine initiative in human affairs. Saul's progressive deterioration—from humility to jealousy to paranoia to necromancy—demonstrates the consequences of covenant unfaithfulness. The book also explores friendship (David and Jonathan), loyalty versus political expediency, and God's mysterious sovereignty in achieving purposes through flawed human agents.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Archaeological evidence provides limited but significant illumination of this period. Shiloh (Khirbet Seilun) excavations reveal destruction layer dating to ca. 1050 BCE, potentially corresponding to the Philistine capture of the ark (4:1-11) and Shiloh's destruction (Jeremiah 7:12 references this event, though 1 Samuel doesn't explicitly describe it). Gibeah (Tell el-Ful), Saul's capital, shows only modest Iron Age I settlement with a small fortress-like structure, consistent with Saul's limited kingdom rather than extensive empire. The site's modest remains align with scholarly views of Saul as transitional chieftain rather than full-fledged monarch. Philistine sites (Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, Gath) show substantial occupation with distinctive pottery and architecture confirming their significant presence and military threat to Israel. Iron technology, monopolized by Philistines according to 1 Samuel 13:19-22, characterizes the period—archaeological evidence shows iron implements becoming more common during Iron Age IIA. Excavations at Keilah, Ziklag, and other sites mentioned in David's flight from Saul show occupation during the relevant period. The absence of substantial fortifications or monumental architecture in Judean highlands during this period aligns with the biblical portrayal of David as fugitive rather than established ruler. The transition to state-level society, visible archaeologically in urbanization and fortification at sites like Megiddo, Hazor, and Gezer, occurred during the 10th century, corresponding to the United Monarchy formation.

**Structure:** The book contains 31 chapters organized around three major sections and figures: (1) Samuel and the end of the judges era (chapters 1-7): Samuel's birth and calling, Eli's failure, Philistine capture and return of the ark, Samuel as judge; (2) Saul's rise and fall (chapters 8-15): Israel's demand for a king, Saul's anointing and initial successes, his disobedience and rejection; (3) David's rise and Saul's decline (chapters 16-31): David's anointing, defeating Goliath, service to Saul, friendship with Jonathan, flight from Saul's jealousy, life as outlaw/mercenary, Saul's consultation with the medium at Endor, Saul's death at Mount Gilboa. The narrative structure emphasizes the transfer of divine favor from Saul to David, with parallel decline-rise trajectories. Multiple traditions about key events appear (two accounts of Saul becoming king, two accounts of David meeting Saul, two accounts of David sparing Saul), suggesting compilation from various sources. The Philistine threat provides consistent background tension driving the monarchy's establishment. The book ends tragically with Saul's death but points forward to David's kingship (2 Samuel). Theologically, the structure demonstrates that human kingship succeeds only under divine authority and covenant obedience—a theme continued throughout the Deuteronomistic History to explain eventual exile as covenant judgment.

### 1 Samuel Chapter 1

Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
And he had two wives; the name of the one
was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD,
were there.
And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.
And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.
And
as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved?
am not I better to thee than ten sons?
So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.
And she
was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.
And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.
Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I
am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunken neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.
Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant
thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more
sad.
And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.
Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel,
saying,
 Because I have asked him of the LORD.
And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband,
I will not go up until the child be weaned, and
then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.
And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.
And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child
was young.
And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
And she said, Oh my lord,
as thy soul liveth, my lord, I
am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.
For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.


### 1 Samuel Chapter 2

And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.
There is none holy as the LORD: for
there is none beside thee: neither
is there any rock like our God.
Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let
not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
The bows of the mighty men
are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and
they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.
He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,
and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set
them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth
are
 the LORD’S, and he hath set the world upon them.
He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.
Now the sons of Eli
were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
And the priest’s custom with the people
was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;
And he struck
it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.
And
if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and
then take
as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him,
Nay; but thou shalt give
it me
 now: and if not, I will take
it by force.
Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
But Samuel ministered before the LORD,
being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought
it
 to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.
And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.
Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled
at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
Nay, my sons; for
it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD’S people to transgress.
If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.
And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.
And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?
And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel
to be
 my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded
in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed
that
 thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.
And thou shalt see an enemy
in my habitation, in all
the wealth which
God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.
And the man of thine,
whom I shall not cut off from mine altar,
shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.
And this
shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.
And I will raise me up a faithful priest,
that shall do according to
that which
is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.
And it shall come to pass,
that every one that is left in thine house shall come
and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.

### 1 Samuel Chapter 26

And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah,
which is before Jeshimon?
Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which
is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.
And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.
Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.
Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not
smite him the second time.
And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD’S anointed, and be guiltless?
David said furthermore,
As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.
The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD’S anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that
is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw
it, nor knew
it, neither awaked: for they
were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.
Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space
being between them:
And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who
art
 thou
that criest to the king?
And David said to Abner,
Art not thou a
valiant
 man? and who
is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.
This thing
is not good that thou hast done.
As
 the LORD liveth, ye
are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD’S anointed. And now see where the king’s spear is, and the cruse of water that
was at his bolster.
And Saul knew David’s voice, and said,
Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said,
It is my voice, my lord, O king.
And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil
is in mine hand?
Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if
they be the children of men, cursed
be
 they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.
Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.
Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.
The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into
my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD’S anointed.
And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
Then Saul said to David, Blessed
be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.


### 1 Samuel Chapter 27

And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul:
there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.
And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that
were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household,
even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.
And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.
And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those
nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.
And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.
And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring
tidings
 to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so
will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.
And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.


### 1 Samuel Chapter 28

And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.
And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.
Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.
And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.
And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold,
there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.
And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me
him up, whom I shall name unto thee.
And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying,
As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou
art
 Saul.
And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.
And he said unto her, What form
is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he
is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it
was Samuel, and he stooped with
his face to the ground, and bowed himself.
And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.
Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?
And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour,
even
 to David:
Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.
Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow
shalt thou and thy sons
be
 with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.
Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded
it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:
And she brought
it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.


### 1 Samuel Chapter 29

Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which
is in Jezreel.
And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.
Then said the princes of the Philistines, What
do these Hebrews
here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines,
Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell
unto me unto this day?
And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master?
should it not
be with the heads of these men?
Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely,
as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host
is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.
Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou
art
 good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master’s servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.
So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.


### 1 Samuel Chapter 30

And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;
And had taken the women captives, that
were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried
them away, and went on their way.
So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.
Then David and the people that
were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.
And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake
them, and without fail recover
all.
So David went, he and the six hundred men that
were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.
But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;
And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk
any water, three days and three nights.
And David said unto him, To whom
belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I
am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.
We made an invasion
upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon
the coast which
belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.
And when he had brought him down, behold,
they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.
And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.
And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any
thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.
And David took all the flocks and the herds,
which they drave before those
other cattle, and said, This
is David’s spoil.
And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that
were
 with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
Then answered all the wicked men and
men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them
ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead
them away, and depart.
Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.
For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part
is that goeth down to the battle, so
shall his part
be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.
And it was
so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.
And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah,
even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;
To
them which
were in Bethel, and to
them
 which
were in south Ramoth, and to
them which
were in Jattir,
And to
them which
were in Aroer, and to
them
 which
were in Siphmoth, and to
them which
were in Eshtemoa,
And to
them which
were in Rachal, and to
them
 which
were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to
them which
were in the cities of the Kenites,
And to
them which
were in Hormah, and to
them
 which
were in Chor-ashan, and to
them which
were in Athach,
And to
them which
were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.

### 1 Samuel Chapter 31

Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchi-shua, Saul’s sons.
And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.
Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.
So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.
And when the men of Israel that
were on the other side of the valley, and
they that
were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish
it in the house of their idols, and among the people.
And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;
All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
And they took their bones, and buried
them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

## 2 Samuel

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** The book of 2 Samuel narrates David's reign as king, approximately 1010-970 BCE according to traditional chronology, corresponding to Iron Age IIA archaeologically. The book covers David's rule over Judah from Hebron (7.5 years, chapters 1-4) and his subsequent reign over united Israel from Jerusalem (33 years, chapters 5-24). Like 1 Samuel, the composition date differs from its setting. Critical scholarship identifies 2 Samuel as part of the Deuteronomistic History, compiled during the late 7th century BCE (Josiah's reign) or 6th century BCE (Babylonian exile). The book incorporates earlier sources, most notably the "Succession Narrative" or "Court History of David" (chapters 9-20, possibly extending to 1 Kings 1-2), considered by many scholars as one of the Bible's oldest prose narratives, potentially from Solomon's reign or shortly thereafter. This source provides remarkably frank portrayal of David's family dysfunction and political intrigue. Other sources likely include official court records, David's laments (chapter 1, 3:33-34), and prophetic traditions (Nathan's oracle, chapter 7). The historical David is confirmed by the 9th-century Tel Dan Stele mentioning the "House of David," though the extent of his kingdom remains debated between maximalist and minimalist scholars.

**Author and Audience:** Traditional attribution to Samuel as author is impossible given that 1 Samuel 25:1 records Samuel's death before David became king. Jewish tradition (Talmud) suggests multiple authors: Samuel for early portions, supplemented by prophets Gad and Nathan. Modern scholarship recognizes Deuteronomistic editing compiling diverse sources into theological history. The Succession Narrative (chapters 9-20) may represent eyewitness or near-contemporary court chronicle, given its detailed knowledge of palace intrigue and relatively neutral portrayal of David's failures. The Deuteronomistic editors shaped these traditions to emphasize covenant theology and explain the Davidic dynasty's theological significance despite eventual exile. The intended audience would be exilic or post-exilic Jews for whom David represented the ideal (though flawed) king and the Davidic Covenant (chapter 7) remained foundational to messianic hopes. The book validates David's kingship and dynasty while honestly depicting his moral failures (Bathsheba, Amnon-Tamar incident, Absalom's revolt), demonstrating that even divinely chosen leaders face consequences for covenant violations yet remain part of divine purposes when repentant.

**Key Themes:** The book develops multiple theological and political themes. David's establishment as king over all Israel fulfills divine promises and establishes the paradigmatic Israelite monarchy. The Davidic Covenant (chapter 7) stands as the book's theological centerpiece: God's promise of eternal dynasty ("your house and your kingdom shall endure forever before me; your throne shall be established forever"—7:16) provides foundation for royal ideology and later messianic expectation. The theme of divine sovereignty working through human actions appears throughout—God establishes David's kingdom, defeats his enemies, and uses even David's failures (Bathsheba affair leading to Solomon's birth and succession) within providential purposes. The tension between divine promise and human failure structures the narrative: David as "man after God's own heart" yet guilty of adultery, murder, and inadequate family leadership. The consequences of sin within covenant relationship appear starkly—Nathan's prophecy that "the sword shall never depart from your house" (12:10) unfolds through Amnon's rape of Tamar, Absalom's murder of Amnon, Absalom's revolt, and succession struggles. Justice and righteousness as royal responsibilities emerge as ideals contrasted with David's failures. The book also explores loyalty and betrayal (Joab's complex character, Ahithophel's defection, Shimei's curse), the relationship between prophet and king (Nathan's confrontation), and Jerusalem as political and religious capital establishing cultic centralization.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Archaeological evidence relating to David's reign remains contested in the maximalist-minimalist debate. The Tel Dan Stele (9th century BCE) provides extra-biblical confirmation of the "House of David" (bytdwd), establishing that David was remembered as dynastic founder within a century of his death. However, direct archaeological evidence from David's reign is limited. Jerusalem (City of David) excavations reveal 10th-century remains, though their interpretation is debated. Eilat Mazar's excavation of the "Large Stone Structure" in the City of David is claimed by some as David's palace, though others date it later or question its identification. The "Stepped Stone Structure" supporting later construction may date to David's period. The archaeological signature of the United Monarchy remains debated: traditional dating attributes monumental architecture at Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer to Solomon, while minimalist scholars (Israel Finkelstein) redate these to the 9th century Omride dynasty, suggesting David and Solomon ruled smaller polities than biblical accounts indicate. The Khirbet Qeiyafa inscription and site (dated to early 10th century) are proposed by some as evidence for centralized Judean authority in David's era, though interpretations vary. The modest material culture of 10th-century Judah contrasts with the biblical portrayal of empire, fueling scholarly debate about the historical extent of David's kingdom versus later idealization.

**Structure:** The book contains 24 chapters organized in clear sections: (1) David becomes king (chapters 1-4): mourning Saul and Jonathan, David's coronation in Hebron, conflict with Ishbosheth, Abner's defection and death; (2) David's successes (chapters 5-10): capturing Jerusalem, bringing the ark to Jerusalem, Davidic Covenant (chapter 7), military conquests establishing empire, kindness to Mephibosheth; (3) David's sin and its consequences (chapters 11-20): Bathsheba and Uriah, Nathan's confrontation, Amnon rapes Tamar, Absalom's revenge and rebellion, David's flight and return, Sheba's revolt—this section constitutes the Succession Narrative showing family dysfunction; (4) Appendix materials (chapters 21-24): various incidents not in chronological order—famine and Gibeonite revenge, David's mighty men, two psalms, census and plague. The structure emphasizes the contrast between David's earlier successes under divine blessing and later failures bringing consequences, yet God's covenant promise remains despite human failure. The Succession Narrative (chapters 9-20) provides remarkably candid political history, asking implicitly "who will succeed David?" and showing how Solomon emerged through elimination of alternatives. The appendix materials seem to have been added as supplementary traditions not fitting the main narrative chronology. Theologically, the structure demonstrates covenant blessings for obedience (chapters 5-8) and covenant curses for disobedience (chapters 11-20), yet divine faithfulness maintaining promises despite human unfaithfulness (chapter 7 remains foundational despite subsequent failures).

### 2 Samuel Chapter 1

Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and
so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here
am I.
And he said unto me, Who
art thou? And I answered him, I
am an Amalekite.
And he said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life
is yet whole in me.
So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that
was upon his head, and the bracelet that
was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.
Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that
were with him:
And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence
art
 thou? And he answered, I
am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?
And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near,
and
 fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
And David said unto him, Thy blood
be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’S anointed.
And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah
the use of
 the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)
The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
Tell
it not in Gath, publish
it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
Ye mountains of Gilboa,
let there be no dew, neither
let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,
as though he had not
been anointed with oil.
From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
Saul and Jonathan
were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with
other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,
thou wast slain in thine high places.
I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

### 2 Samuel Chapter 24

And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.
For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which
was
 with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.
And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see
it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?
Notwithstanding the king’s word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that
lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:
Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon,
And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah,
even to Beer-sheba.
So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah
were five hundred thousand men.
And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,
Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three
things; choose thee one of them, that I may
do it unto thee.
So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies
are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.
So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.
And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.
And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s house.
And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.
And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.
And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.
And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what
seemeth good unto him: behold,
here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and
other instruments of the oxen for wood.
All
these things did Araunah,
as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.
And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy
it
 of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

## 1 Kings

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** The book of 1 Kings covers approximately 970-850 BCE, from Solomon's accession through the divided monarchy's first decades. The book spans Solomon's entire reign (ca. 970-930 BCE, chapters 1-11) and the early divided kingdom period (ca. 930-850 BCE, chapters 12-22), ending with Ahab's death and Jehoshaphat's continued reign. This corresponds to Iron Age IIA-B archaeologically, a period of significant state formation in the Levant. The book's composition, however, dates much later. As part of the Deuteronomistic History, 1 Kings was compiled/edited during the late 7th century BCE (Josiah's reign) or 6th century BCE (Babylonian exile), incorporating earlier sources. These sources likely included: the "Book of the Acts of Solomon" (11:41), "Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel" (14:19 and frequently), "Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah" (14:29 and frequently), temple records, and prophetic traditions (Elijah and Elisha cycles). The archaeological debate over Solomon's kingdom remains intense: traditional scholars attribute monumental architecture at Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer to Solomon (matching 1 Kings 9:15), while minimalist scholars (Finkelstein) redate these structures to the 9th century Omride dynasty, suggesting Solomon's kingdom was more modest than biblical portrayal.

**Author and Audience:** Like the broader Deuteronomistic History, 1 Kings reflects Deuteronomistic editorial shaping, though incorporating earlier sources. The repetitive formulas introducing and concluding each king's reign ("In the Xth year of king Y of Judah, king Z began to reign over Israel...he did evil/right in the sight of the LORD...") suggest compilation from official chronicles. The theological evaluation of each king according to Deuteronomic standards (exclusive Yahweh worship at Jerusalem temple versus idolatry and high places) reveals editorial perspective. The intended audience would be exilic or post-exilic Jews seeking to understand why the kingdoms fell: the Deuteronomistic theology explains exile as covenant judgment for persistent idolatry, beginning with Solomon's apostasy through foreign wives (chapter 11) and continuing through the northern kingdom's Baal worship and southern kingdom's syncretism. The book validates centralized Jerusalem worship while condemning alternative sanctuaries (Bethel, Dan). The prophetic traditions (Elijah confronting Ahab and Baal worship) establish prophetic authority to call kings to covenant accountability. The contrast between Solomon's early wisdom and later apostasy demonstrates that even divinely blessed kings fail when abandoning exclusive Yahwism.

**Key Themes:** The book develops several theological themes structuring its historical narrative. Temple centralization appears paramount: Solomon's temple construction (chapters 5-8) establishes Jerusalem as the exclusive legitimate worship site, fulfilling David's desire and God's promise. The temple dedication prayer (chapter 8) emphasizes that even this magnificent structure cannot contain God, yet serves as focal point for prayer and covenant relationship. The theme of covenant obedience versus idolatry drives the narrative: Solomon's apostasy through foreign wives and their deities (chapter 11) brings divine judgment—kingdom division. The Deuteronomistic theology evaluates every king by faithfulness to exclusive Yahweh worship: southern kings are measured against David (the ideal, though flawed), northern kings condemned for continuing "the sin of Jeroboam" (golden calves at Bethel and Dan). Prophetic authority challenging royal power continues from Samuel-Nathan tradition: the prophet Ahijah announces kingdom division (11:29-39), unnamed prophets condemn Jeroboam (13:1-10; 14:1-18), and Elijah confronts Ahab's Baal worship (chapters 17-19, 21), establishing that prophets speak divine word to which kings must submit. Divine sovereignty working through historical events appears throughout: God divides the kingdom as judgment, preserves Davidic dynasty for covenant promises' sake, controls international affairs. Wisdom as divine gift appears in Solomon's early reign but proves insufficient without covenant faithfulness.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Archaeological evidence relating to 1 Kings events presents complex testimony. Solomon's building activities remain debated: the monumental six-chambered gates and casemate walls at Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer were traditionally attributed to Solomon based on 1 Kings 9:15, but minimalist scholars now attribute some to the 9th-century Omride dynasty. Recent excavations support earlier (10th-century) dating for some structures, though debate continues. Jerusalem temple archaeology is unavailable due to the Temple Mount's sensitivity, but comparative evidence from Phoenician and Syrian temples illuminates the description in 1 Kings 6-7. The temple's tripartite structure (porch, holy place, holy of holies) matches Syro-Phoenician architectural patterns. The Gezer calendar (10th century) evidences administrative literacy consistent with Solomonic bureaucracy. For the divided kingdom period, the Mesha Stele (9th century) provides Moabite perspective on conflicts with Israel, mentioning Omri. Tel Dan Stele fragment (9th century) references the "House of David" and possibly Jehoram, confirming Davidic dynasty and northern-southern conflicts. Samaria excavations reveal Omride-era palatial architecture and the "Samaria Ostraca" documenting administrative systems. Excavations at Tel Jezreel reveal substantial 9th-century fortress, likely Ahab's "second capital." Phoenician influence evident in material culture aligns with Hiram-Solomon partnership and Jezebel's Phoenician origin. The Elijah narratives' references to Baal worship are illuminated by Phoenician religious practices known from archaeological and textual evidence (Ugaritic texts).

**Structure:** The book contains 22 chapters divided into three major sections: (1) Solomon's reign (chapters 1-11): succession struggle, Solomon established as king, wisdom and wealth, temple and palace construction, Queen of Sheba visit, Solomon's apostasy through foreign wives, prophetic announcement of kingdom division; (2) Kingdom division and early rulers (chapters 12-16): Rehoboam's folly and northern secession, Jeroboam's golden calves at Bethel and Dan, succession of northern kings (Jeroboam, Nadab, Baasha, Elah, Zimri, Omri, Ahab) and southern kings (Rehoboam, Abijam, Asa, Jehoshaphat begins), each evaluated deuteronomistically; (3) Elijah cycle (chapters 17-22): Elijah confronts Ahab and Baal worship, drought and Mount Carmel contest, flight to Horeb, Naboth's vineyard, Ahab's wars with Aram, Ahab's death. The structure demonstrates theological interpretation of history: Solomon's glory results from divine blessing but his apostasy brings judgment (kingdom division); northern kingdom's persistent apostasy through Jeroboam's cultic innovations and Ahab's Baal worship provokes prophetic opposition; southern kingdom maintains Davidic dynasty and Jerusalem temple but struggles with high places and syncretism. The alternating accounts of northern and southern kings, synchronized chronologically, shows their interrelated yet distinct histories. Prophetic narratives (especially Elijah) interrupt royal annals, demonstrating prophetic authority over royal power in covenant enforcement. The book ends mid-narrative (Ahab's death), continuing seamlessly into 2 Kings, showing that 1-2 Kings originally formed single work divided later for scroll length.

### 1 Kings Chapter 1

Now king David was old
and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.
Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
And the damsel
was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.
Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also
was a very goodly
man; and
his mother bare him after Absalom.
And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped
him.
But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which
belonged
 to David, were not with Adonijah.
And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which
is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants:
But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth
it not?
Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?
Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.
And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?
And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid,
saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest
it not:
And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel
are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.
But me,
even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed
it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.
And the king sware, and said,
As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,
Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
Then Bath-sheba bowed with
her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.
Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so
too.
As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.
And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.
And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
And Adonijah and all the guests that
were with him heard
it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore
is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou
art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule:
And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This
is the noise that ye have heard.
And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
And also thus said the king, Blessed
be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given
one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing
it.
And all the guests that
were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.
And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.


### 1 Kings Chapter 2

Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;
And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:
That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that
was about his loins, and in his shoes that
were on his feet.
Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.
But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
And, behold,
thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou
art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.
So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
And the days that David reigned over Israel
were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.
And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and
that
 all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the LORD.
And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.
And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.
And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.
Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.
Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee;
I pray thee,
 say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.
And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.
And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he
is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.
Now therefore,
as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.
And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou
art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold,
he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.
And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing
thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.
So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.
For it shall be,
that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
And Shimei said unto the king, The saying
is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants
be in Gath.
And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.
And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.
And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word
that I have heard
is good.
Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?
The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;
And king Solomon
shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.
So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.


### 1 Kings Chapter 3

And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.
And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that
was
 the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as
it is
 this day.
And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I
am but a little child: I know not
how
 to go out or come in.
And thy servant
is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?
And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.
And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.
And Solomon awoke; and, behold,
it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
Then came there two women,
that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.
And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we
were together;
there was
 no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.
And the other woman said, Nay; but the living
is my son, and the dead
is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead
is
 thy son, and the living
is my son. Thus they spake before the king.
Then said the king, The one saith, This
is my son that liveth, and thy son
is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son
is the dead, and my son
is the living.
And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
Then spake the woman whose the living child
was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine,
but divide
it.
Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she
is the mother thereof.
And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God
was in him, to do judgment.


### 1 Kings Chapter 4

So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
And these
were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,
Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar
were the priests:
And Azariah the son of Nathan
was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan
was principal officer,
and the king’s friend:
And Ahishar
was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda
was over the tribute.
And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.
And these
are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:
The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan:
The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him
pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:
The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
Baana the son of Ahilud;
to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah,
even unto
the place that is beyond Jokneam:
The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him
pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which
are in Gilead; to him
also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars:
Ahinadab the son of Iddo
had Mahanaim:
Ahimaaz
was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
Baanah the son of Hushai
was in Asher and in Aloth:
Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:
Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:
Geber the son of Uri
was in the country of Gilead,
in
 the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and
he was the only officer which
was in the land.
Judah and Israel
were many, as the sand which
is
 by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.
And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,
Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.
For he had dominion over all
the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.
And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.
Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where
the officers were, every man according to his charge.
And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that
is on the sea shore.
And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.
And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that
is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.
And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.


### 1 Kings Chapter 5

And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side,
so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.
Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that
there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.
And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed
be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.
And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for:
and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
My servants shall bring
them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive
them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees
according to
 all his desire.
And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat
for
 food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon,
and two months at home: and Adoniram
was over the levy.
And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;
Beside the chief of Solomon’s officers which
were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.
And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones,
and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.
And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew
them,
 and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.

### 1 Kings Chapter 6

And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which
is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof
was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty
cubits,
 and the height thereof thirty cubits.
And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits
was
 the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house;
and
 ten cubits
was the breadth thereof before the house.
And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
against the walls of the house round about,
both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:
The nethermost chamber
was five cubits broad, and the middle
was six cubits broad, and the third
was seven cubits broad: for without
in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that
the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe
nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
The door for the middle chamber
was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle
chamber,
 and out of the middle into the third.
So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
And
then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house
with timber of cedar.
And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,
Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:
And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling:
and he covered
them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built
them for it within,
even for the oracle,
even for the most holy
place.
And the house, that
is, the temple before it, was forty cubits
long.
And the cedar of the house within
was carved with knops and open flowers: all
was cedar; there was no stone seen.
And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
And the oracle in the forepart
was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar
which was of
 cedar.
So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that
was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.
And within the oracle he made two cherubims
of olive tree,
each ten cubits high.
And five cubits
was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other
were ten cubits.
And the other cherub
was ten cubits: both the cherubims
were of one measure and one size.
The height of the one cherub
was ten cubits, and so
was it of the other cherub.
And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the
one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.
And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
And for the entering of the oracle he made doors
of olive tree: the lintel
and side posts
were a fifth part
of the wall.
The two doors also
were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid
them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.
So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part
of the wall.
And the two doors
were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door
were folding, and the two leaves of the other door
were
 folding.
And he carved
thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered
them with gold fitted upon the carved work.
And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.
In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:
And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which
is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.


### 1 Kings Chapter 7

But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof
was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
And
it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that
lay on forty five pillars, fifteen
in a row.
And
there were windows
in three rows, and light
was against light
in three ranks.
And all the doors and posts
were square, with the windows: and light
was against light
in three ranks.
And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof
was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the
other pillars and the thick beam
were before them.
Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge,
even
 the porch of judgment: and
it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
And his house where he dwelt
had another court within the porch,
which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken
to wife, like unto this porch.
All these
were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.
And the foundation
was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
And above
were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.
And the great court round about
was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.
And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
He
was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father
was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.
And he made two chapiters
of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter
was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter
was five cubits:
And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which
were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.
And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that
were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.
And the chapiters that
were upon the top of the pillars
were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.
And the chapiters upon the two pillars
had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which
was by the network: and the pomegranates
were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.
And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and he called the name thereof Boaz.
And upon the top of the pillars
was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other:
it was round all about, and his height
was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
And under the brim of it round about
there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops
were cast in two rows, when it was cast.
It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea
was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts
were inward.
And it
was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.
And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits
was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
And the work of the bases
was on this
manner: they had borders, and the borders
were between the ledges:
And on the borders that
were between the ledges
were
 lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges
there was
 a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen
were certain additions made of thin work.
And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver
were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.
And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above
was a cubit: but the mouth thereof
was round
after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it
were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.
And under the borders
were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels
were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel
was a cubit and a half a cubit.
And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes,
were
 all molten.
And
there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base:
and the undersetters
were of the very base itself.
And in the top of the base
was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof
were of the same.
For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.
After this
manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure,
and one size.
Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths:
and every laver was four cubits:
and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.
And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.
And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:
The two pillars, and the
two bowls of the chapiters that
were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which
were upon the top of the pillars;
And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks,
even
 two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that
were upon the pillars;
And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD,
were of
 bright brass.
In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.
And Solomon left all the vessels
unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.
And Solomon made all the vessels that
pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread
was,
And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right
side,
 and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs
of gold,
And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers
of pure gold; and the hinges
of gold,
both
 for the doors of the inner house, the most holy
place, and
 for the doors of the house,
to wit, of the temple.
So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated;
even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.

## 1 Chronicles

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** 1 Chronicles retells Israel's history from Adam through David's reign (c. 1010-970 BCE), covering the same period as Genesis through 2 Samuel but with distinct theological perspective and purpose. The narrative portion focuses on David's reign while genealogies trace Israel's lineage from creation. The book's composition date differs significantly from the events described: scholarly consensus dates Chronicles to the post-exilic period, approximately 450-400 BCE (some propose as late as 350 BCE), several centuries after David's death. Evidence for this late dating includes: linguistic features of Late Biblical Hebrew similar to Ezra-Nehemiah, concern with temple worship and Levitical organization reflecting Second Temple priorities, genealogies extending to post-exilic generations (1 Chr 3:17-24 lists David's descendants six generations after the exile), and theological emphases addressing post-exilic community needs. The Chronicler (term for the anonymous author/editor) likely wrote during Persian rule when the returned exiles were rebuilding Jerusalem and reconstituting Jewish identity around the temple. Some scholars propose single authorship with Ezra-Nehemiah (the Chronicler's History theory), though current scholarship increasingly treats these as separate works. The Chronicler used earlier sources including Samuel-Kings, plus additional materials not preserved elsewhere, reworking Israel's history to emphasize temple worship, Levitical roles, David's legacy, and divine blessing for covenant faithfulness—themes crucial for the struggling post-exilic community seeking to rebuild national and religious identity.

**Author and Audience:** 1 Chronicles' authorship is anonymous, with ancient tradition (Babylonian Talmud, Baba Batra 15a) attributing it to Ezra the scribe, though modern scholarship doubts this identification while recognizing priestly/Levitical authorial concerns. The author, conventionally called "the Chronicler," demonstrates intimate knowledge of temple worship, priestly duties, Levitical organization, and liturgical music, suggesting background in Jerusalem's temple establishment. The Chronicler explicitly cites numerous sources: "the book of the kings of Israel and Judah," "the annals of King David," prophetic writings attributed to Samuel, Nathan, Gad, Ahijah, Iddo, and others—indicating compilation from earlier traditions rather than eyewitness account. The intended audience was the post-exilic Jewish community in Jerusalem and Judah (Yehud under Persian administration), struggling with identity questions: Who are we as God's people without monarchy? How do we relate to pre-exilic Israel? What is our purpose and hope? The Chronicler answers by emphasizing continuity with pre-exilic Israel through genealogies connecting post-exilic Jews to David and ultimately Adam, by idealizing David and Solomon as founders of proper temple worship, by highlighting Levitical roles (legitimizing current temple personnel), and by demonstrating that covenant faithfulness brings blessing while sin brings judgment—offering hope that renewed obedience will restore divine favor. The genealogies (1 Chr 1-9) establish identity and legitimate claims of returned exiles. The focus on "all Israel" (rather than just Judah) suggests the Chronicler seeks to unify post-exilic Jews around common heritage and worship.

**Key Themes:** 1 Chronicles develops distinctive theological emphases differing from Samuel-Kings' parallel narratives. **David as ideal king and worship founder** dominates: Chronicles omits David's sins (Bathsheba, Uriah, Absalom's revolt), instead presenting him as paradigmatic righteous king whose primary accomplishment was organizing temple worship, gathering materials for temple construction, establishing Levitical duties, and creating liturgical music. This idealized David provides a model for post-exilic leadership. **Temple centrality and worship organization**: Extensive attention to temple preparation (chs. 22-29), Levitical genealogies and duties (chs. 6, 15-16, 23-26), musical guilds (ch. 25), gatekeepers (ch. 26), and David's detailed plans demonstrates that proper worship constitutes Israel's central purpose. **All Israel unity**: Chronicles emphasizes "all Israel" supporting David, downplaying northern-southern division, suggesting post-exilic unity around Jerusalem's temple. **Immediate retribution theology**: Unlike Samuel-Kings' complex presentations, Chronicles typically shows immediate divine response—obedience brings blessing, disobedience brings punishment—encouraging post-exilic faithfulness. **Genealogical continuity**: Nine chapters of genealogies (1 Chr 1-9) establish unbroken connection from Adam through Abraham, David, and exile to post-exilic community, legitimizing returned exiles' identity as covenant people. **Divine sovereignty and providence**: God controls history, raises David, defeats enemies, and establishes his purposes through human actions. **Priestly and Levitical legitimacy**: Detailed attention to priestly and Levitical families, duties, and organization legitimizes Second Temple personnel. **Hope through covenant faithfulness**: Despite exile's catastrophe, covenant relationship continues, and renewed obedience promises restoration and blessing.

**Archaeological Relevance:** 1 Chronicles' historical reliability is debated, with archaeological evidence providing partial corroboration while raising questions about the Chronicler's idealized presentation. The book retells narratives from Samuel-Kings, sharing their archaeological connections (Tel Dan Stele confirming David's dynasty, City of David excavations, etc.). However, Chronicles adds details not in earlier sources, raising historicity questions. **David's empire**: Chronicles presents extensive Davidic conquests and empire, supported by some archaeological evidence (10th century BCE Israelite expansion into previously Canaanite areas, destruction layers at some sites), though the extent remains debated between maximalists (accepting Chronicles' picture) and minimalists (viewing it as retrojection of later aspirations). **Temple preparations**: Chronicles' extensive descriptions of David's temple preparations, while theologically motivated, may reflect actual temple building practices. **Lists and genealogies**: Some genealogical information finds archaeological correlation (seal impressions, ostraca confirming personal names, family names appearing in extra-biblical sources), while other material appears schematic or theologically constructed. **Administrative organization**: Chronicles' descriptions of Davidic administrative structure (military organization, regional governance, temple personnel) find partial confirmation in archaeological evidence for monarchic period administration, though details may be idealized or anachronistic. **Philistine conflict**: Archaeological evidence confirms Philistine-Israelite conflict in the 10th century BCE matching Chronicles' accounts, with Philistine material culture distinct from Israelite in this period. The key interpretive question is whether Chronicles preserves genuine historical traditions not in Samuel-Kings or represents theological expansion of earlier sources. Most scholars view Chronicles as blend of earlier tradition and theological interpretation serving post-exilic needs.

**Structure:** 1 Chronicles contains 29 chapters divided into two major sections: genealogical prologue and David's reign narrative. **Part I: Genealogies (1:1-9:44):** Nine chapters trace Israel's lineage establishing identity and continuity. Chapter 1 covers Adam to Abraham (universal history narrowing to chosen line). Chapter 2-4 detail Judah's descendants (David's tribe), emphasizing royal and Calebite lines. Chapter 5 treats Trans-Jordanian tribes (Reuben, Gad, Manasseh). Chapter 6 focuses on Levites, especially high priestly line and Levitical cities, establishing temple personnel legitimacy. Chapter 7 covers remaining northern tribes (Issachar, Benjamin, Naphtali, Manasseh, Ephraim, Asher). Chapter 8 provides expanded Benjamin genealogy (Saul's tribe). Chapter 9 lists post-exilic returnees to Jerusalem, connecting pre-exilic and post-exilic communities. **Part II: David's Reign (10:1-29:30):** Chapters 10 briefly covers Saul's death (explaining why David received kingdom). Chapters 11-12 describe David's anointing and mighty warriors (all Israel supporting him). Chapter 13-16 recount bringing the ark to Jerusalem, establishing worship and Levitical duties (David's central accomplishment). Chapters 17-20 cover David's wars and victories, Nathan's dynastic oracle, and Davidic covenant. Chapters 21-22 describe David's census sin, plague, purchasing threshing floor, and beginning temple preparations. Chapters 23-27 detail extensive organizational arrangements: Levitical divisions, priestly courses, musicians, gatekeepers, military divisions, tribal leaders, and administrative officials. Chapters 28-29 record David's final words, Solomon's appointment, temple plans' transmission, offerings for temple construction, David's prayer, and death. The structure emphasizes worship organization as David's primary legacy, providing a blueprint for post-exilic temple community.

Now Benjamin begat Bela his firstborn, Ashbel the second, and Aharah the third,
Nohah the fourth, and Rapha the fifth.
And the sons of Bela were, Addar, and Gera, and Abihud,
And Abishua, and Naaman, and Ahoah,
And Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram.
And these
are the sons of Ehud: these are the heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of Geba, and they removed them to Manahath:
And Naaman, and Ahiah, and Gera, he removed them, and begat Uzza, and Ahihud.
And Shaharaim begat
children in the country of Moab, after he had sent them away; Hushim and Baara
were his wives.
And he begat of Hodesh his wife, Jobab, and Zibia, and Mesha, and Malcham,
And Jeuz, and Shachia, and Mirma. These
were his sons, heads of the fathers.
And of Hushim he begat Abitub, and Elpaal.
The sons of Elpaal; Eber, and Misham, and Shamed, who built Ono, and Lod, with the towns thereof:
Beriah also, and Shema, who
were heads of the fathers of the inhabitants of Aijalon, who drove away the inhabitants of Gath:
And Ahio, Shashak, and Jeremoth,
And Zebadiah, and Arad, and Ader,
And Michael, and Ispah, and Joha, the sons of Beriah;
And Zebadiah, and Meshullam, and Hezeki, and Heber,
Ishmerai also, and Jezliah, and Jobab, the sons of Elpaal;
And Jakim, and Zichri, and Zabdi,
And Elienai, and Zilthai, and Eliel,
And Adaiah, and Beraiah, and Shimrath, the sons of Shimhi;
And Ishpan, and Heber, and Eliel,
And Abdon, and Zichri, and Hanan,
And Hananiah, and Elam, and Antothijah,
And Iphedeiah, and Penuel, the sons of Shashak;
And Shamsherai, and Shehariah, and Athaliah,
And Jaresiah, and Eliah, and Zichri, the sons of Jeroham.
These
were heads of the fathers, by their generations, chief
men. These dwelt in Jerusalem.
And at Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon; whose wife’s name
was
 Maachah:
And his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Nadab,
And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zacher.
And Mikloth begat Shimeah. And these also dwelt with their brethren in Jerusalem, over against them.
And Ner begat Kish, and Kish begat Saul, and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Esh-baal.
And the son of Jonathan
was Merib-baal; and Merib-baal begat Micah.
And the sons of Micah
were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tarea, and Ahaz.
And Ahaz begat Jehoadah; and Jehoadah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza,
And Moza begat Binea: Rapha
was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son:
And Azel had six sons, whose names
are these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan. All these
were the sons of Azel.
And the sons of Eshek his brother
were, Ulam his firstborn, Jehush the second, and Eliphelet the third.
And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valour, archers, and had many sons, and sons’ sons, an hundred and fifty. All these
are of the sons of Benjamin.


### 1 Chronicles Chapter 9

So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they
were
 written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah,
who
 were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.
Now the first inhabitants that
dwelt in their possessions in their cities
were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims.
And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh;
Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah.
And of the Shilonites; Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons.
And of the sons of Zerah; Jeuel, and their brethren, six hundred and ninety.
And of the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah,
And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephatiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah;
And their brethren, according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty and six. All these men
were chief of the fathers in the house of their fathers.
And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin,
And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God;
And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer;
And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God.
And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;
And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;
And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.
And the porters
were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum
was the chief;
Who hitherto
waited in the king’s gate eastward: they were porters in the companies of the children of Levi.
And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites,
were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers,
being over the host of the LORD,
were keepers of the entry.
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past,
and the Lord
was with him.
And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah
was porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
All these
which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office.
So they and their children
had the oversight of the gates of the house of the Lord,
namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards.
In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south.
And their brethren,
which were in their villages,
were
 to come after seven days from time to time with them.
For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in
their
 set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.
And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge
was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning
pertained
 to them.
And
certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by tale.
Some of them also
were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.
And
some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices.
And Mattithiah,
one of the Levites, who
was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans.
And
other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites,
were over the shewbread, to prepare
it every sabbath.
And these
are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites,
who remaining in the chambers
were free: for they were employed in that work day and night.
These chief fathers of the Levites
were chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.
And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife’s name
was Maachah:
And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab,
And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.
And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.
And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Esh-baal.
And the son of Jonathan
was Merib-baal: and Merib-baal begat Micah.
And the sons of Micah
were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea,
and Ahaz.
And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;
And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.
And Azel had six sons, whose names
are these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these
were
 the sons of Azel.


### 1 Chronicles Chapter 10

Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.
Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.
So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.
And when all the men of Israel that
were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.
And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD,
even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking
counsel of
one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire
of it;
And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.

### 1 Chronicles Chapter 11

Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we
are thy bone and thy flesh.
And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou
wast
 he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.
Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.
And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which
is Jebus; where the Jebusites
were, the inhabitants of the land.
And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which
is the city of David.
And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.
And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.
And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts
was
 with him.
These also
are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom,
and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
And this
is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain
by him at one time.
And after him
was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who
was one of the three mighties.
He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
And they set themselves in the midst of
that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved
them
 by a great deliverance.
Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
And David
was then in the hold, and the Philistines’ garrison
was then at Bethlehem.
And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that
is at the gate!
And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that
was by the gate, and took
it, and brought
it to David: but David would not drink
of it, but poured it out to the LORD,
And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with
the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.
And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew
them, and had a name among the three.
Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the
first three.
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.
And he slew an Egyptian, a man of
great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand
was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.
These
things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.
Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the
first three: and David set him over his guard.
Also the valiant men of the armies
were, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abi-ezer the Antothite,
Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,
Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah,
that pertained to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,
Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,
Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,
Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,
Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,
Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,
Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,
Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,
Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite,
Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,
Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,
Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.


### 1 Chronicles Chapter 12

Now these
are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they
were
 among the mighty men, helpers of the war.
They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in
hurling stones and
shooting arrows out of a bow,
even of Saul’s brethren of Benjamin.
The chief
was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite,
And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite,
Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,
Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites,
And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderness men of might,
and men of war
fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces
were like
 the faces of lions, and
were as swift as the roes upon the mountains;
Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.
These
were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least
was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.
These
are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all
them
 of the valleys,
both toward the east, and toward the west.
And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.
And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if
ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing
there is
 no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look
thereon,
 and rebuke
it.
Then the spirit came upon Amasai,
who was chief of the captains,
and he said, Thine
are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace
be unto thee, and peace
be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.
And there fell
some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to
the jeopardy of our heads.
As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that
were of Manasseh.
And they helped David against the band
of the rovers: for they
were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.
For at
that time day by day there came to David to help him, until
it was a great host, like the host of God.
And these
are the numbers of the bands
that were
 ready armed to the war,
and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.
The children of Judah that bare shield and spear
were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.
Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.
Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.
And Jehoiada
was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him
were three thousand and seven hundred;
And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father’s house twenty and two captains.
And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.
And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.
And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king.
And of the children of Issachar,
which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them
were two hundred; and all their brethren
were at their commandment.
Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank:
they were
 not of double heart.
And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.
And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.
And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.
And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.
All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel
were of one heart to make David king.
And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.
Moreover they that were nigh them,
even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen,
and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for
there was joy in Israel.


### 1 Chronicles Chapter 13

And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds,
and with every leader.
And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If
it seem
 good unto you, and
that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where,
that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them
also to the priests and Levites
which are in their cities
and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:
And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.
And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.
And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah,
that is, to Kirjath-jearim, which
belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth
between the cherubims, whose name is called
on it.
And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.
And David and all Israel played before God with all
their
 might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.
And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.
And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God
home to me?
So David brought not the ark
home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.


### 1 Chronicles Chapter 14

Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.
And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.
And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.
Now these
are the names of
his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,
And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.
And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard
of it, and went out against them.
And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.
So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.
And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.
Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.
And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees,
that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.
David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.
And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.


### 1 Chronicles Chapter 15

And
David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.
Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.
And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.
And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:
Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:
Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:
Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:
Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:
Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:
Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.
And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
And said unto them, Ye
are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves,
both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto
the place that
 I have prepared for it.
For because ye
did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.
So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.
And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.
And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren
to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.
So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
And with them their brethren of the second
degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters.
So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan,
were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass;
And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;
And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.
And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites,
was for song: he instructed about the song, because he
was skilful.
And Berechiah and Elkanah
were doorkeepers for the ark.
And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah
were doorkeepers for the ark.
So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.
And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.
And David
was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also
had upon him an ephod of linen.
Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.
And it came to pass,
as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.

## 2 Chronicles

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** 2 Chronicles continues from 1 Chronicles, covering Solomon's reign (c. 970-930 BCE) through Judah's Babylonian exile (586 BCE), paralleling 1 Kings 1-11 and all of 2 Kings but focusing exclusively on Judah's Davidic dynasty. Composed in the post-exilic period (c. 450-400 BCE) alongside 1 Chronicles, the book spans approximately 400 years of monarchic history. The narrative emphasizes Solomon's temple construction and glory, then traces Judean kings' reigns evaluating each by temple faithfulness and covenant obedience. Key periods include: Solomon's prosperous reign and temple dedication (chs. 1-9), the kingdom's division after Rehoboam's folly (ch. 10), alternating faithfulness and apostasy under successive kings, reforming kings like Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah (who receive extensive positive coverage), wicked kings like Ahaz and Manasseh, and final collapse under Babylon ending with Cyrus's decree permitting return (36:22-23). The Chronicler uses sources including Kings, plus additional temple-focused material, writing for post-exilic Jews rebuilding temple and community.

**Author and Audience:** Written by the anonymous Chronicler (same author/circle as 1 Chronicles), demonstrating priestly/Levitical concerns and intimate temple knowledge. Ancient tradition attributes authorship to Ezra, though scholarly consensus favors anonymous authorship. The Chronicler addresses post-exilic Jews in Yehud (Persian-period Judah) who had returned from exile, rebuilt the Second Temple (520-515 BCE), but lacked monarchy and struggled with identity. The book answers: How should we understand our past? What caused exile? What brings divine blessing? By emphasizing temple centrality, immediate retribution (faithfulness brings blessing, sin brings judgment), and hope through covenant obedience, the Chronicler provides theological framework for post-exilic restoration. The ending—Cyrus's decree—offers hope: exile isn't final; God can restore his people.

**Key Themes:** **Temple centrality**: Solomon's temple construction and dedication (chs. 2-7) receives extensive coverage, with temple worship constituting Israel's purpose. **Immediate retribution**: Unlike Kings' complex theology, Chronicles shows direct correlation—obedience brings military victory, prosperity, peace; disobedience brings defeat, illness, death. **Seeking God**: The phrase "seek the LORD/God" appears repeatedly; those who seek prosper, those who forsake suffer. **Reform and apostasy cycles**: Reforming kings (Asa, Jehoshaphat, Joash, Hezekiah, Josiah) restore proper worship; wicked kings lead people astray. **Prayer and divine response**: Extensive prayers by Solomon (ch. 6), Jehoshaphat (20:6-12), Hezekiah (30:18-20) show God responds to humble petition. **"All Israel" unity**: Despite northern kingdom's absence, Chronicles emphasizes "all Israel" should worship at Jerusalem. **Davidic covenant hope**: Focus on Judah's Davidic line (ignoring northern kings entirely) maintains hope in covenant promises despite exile.

**Archaeological Relevance:** 2 Chronicles shares 1-2 Kings' archaeological framework (Assyrian records, Babylonian Chronicles, Lachish reliefs, Siloam Tunnel, Hezekiah's seals, Tel Dan Stele, destruction layers), while adding details debated for historicity. Chronicles' expanded accounts of building projects (Solomon's temple, fortified cities, Asa's fortifications, Jehoshaphat's forts, Hezekiah's preparations) find partial archaeological support in Iron Age II fortification systems and administrative structures. The Chronicler's numbers (army sizes, wealth, spoils) often exceed Kings and may be schematic or rhetorical. Archaeological evidence confirms the general historical framework—Davidic dynasty, temple existence, Assyrian and Babylonian threats, exile—while specific details require careful evaluation. Post-exilic setting explains theological emphases and additional material not in Kings.

**Structure:** 36 chapters: **Part I: Solomon's Glory (1-9):** Temple construction, dedication, divine approval, international fame, wealth—ideal king embodying covenant blessings. **Part II: Divided Kingdom—Judah Only (10-36):** Rehoboam's folly dividing kingdom, then exclusive focus on Judah's Davidic kings: reformers receive extensive positive coverage (Asa ch. 14-16, Jehoshaphat 17-20, Joash 24, Hezekiah 29-32, Josiah 34-35); wicked kings receive brief, negative accounts (Ahaz 28, Manasseh 33); pattern demonstrates retribution theology. Ends with Jerusalem's destruction, exile, and Cyrus's decree (36:15-23) offering hope for restoration.

### 2 Chronicles Chapter 9

And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.
And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
And she said to the king,
It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:
Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen
it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me:
for thou exceedest the fame that I heard.
Happy
are thy men, and happy
are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne,
to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.
And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.
And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.
And the king made
of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king’s palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside
that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.
Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;
Beside
that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred
shekels of beaten gold went to one target.
And three hundred shields
made he of beaten gold: three hundred
shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
And
there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,
which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays:
And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon
were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon
were of pure gold: none
were of silver; it was
not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.
And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that
are in the low plains in abundance.
And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last,
are
 they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.


### 2 Chronicles Chapter 10

And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king.
And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
was
 in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard
it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying,
Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.
And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye
me to return answer to this people?
And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.
But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?
And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou
it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little
finger shall be thicker than my father’s loins.
For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I
will chastise you
 with scorpions.
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I
will chastise you with scorpions.
So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
And when all Israel
saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and
we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel:
and now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.
But
as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that
was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to
his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

### 2 Chronicles Chapter 11

And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen
men,
 which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.
He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
And Beth-zur, and Shoco, and Adullam,
And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which
are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.
And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.
And in every several city
he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
And the priests and the Levites that
were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.
For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest’s office unto the LORD:
And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.
So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.
And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife,
and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;
Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)
And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for
he thought to make him king.
And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.


### 2 Chronicles Chapter 12

And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.
And it came to pass,
that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,
With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people
were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
And he took the fenced cities which
pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and
to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD
is righteous.
And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves;
therefore
 I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed
them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king’s house.
And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.
And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him that he would not destroy
him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.
So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam
was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother’s name
was Naamah an Ammonitess.
And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.
Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last,
are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And
there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.


### 2 Chronicles Chapter 13

Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also
was
 Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war,
even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men,
being
 mighty men of valour.
And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which
is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;
Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever,
even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.
And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.
And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye
be a great multitude, and
there are
 with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.
Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of
other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams,
the same may be a priest of
them that are no gods.
But as for us, the LORD
is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD,
are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites
wait upon
their business:
And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also
set they in order
 upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.
And, behold, God himself is with us for
our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.
But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment
was behind them.
And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle
was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.
And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.
And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.
Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.
But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings,
are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.


### 2 Chronicles Chapter 14

So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.
And Asa did
that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:
For he took away the altars of the strange
gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:
And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.
Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about
them walls, and towers, gates, and bars,
while the land
is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought
him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
And Asa had an army
of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these
were mighty men of valour.
And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.
Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD,
it is
 nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou
art our God; let not man prevail against thee.
So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.
And Asa and the people that
were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.
And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.
They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.


### 2 Chronicles Chapter 15

And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:
And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD
is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.
Now for a long season Israel
hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
And in those times
there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations
were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.
And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.
Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.
And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that
was before the porch of the LORD.
And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God
was with him.
So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil
which
 they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.
And also
concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from
being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped
it, and burnt
it at the brook Kidron.
But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
And there was no
more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.

### 2 Chronicles Chapter 16

In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
There is a league between me and thee, as
there was
 between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
And it came to pass, when Baasha heard
it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.
Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.
Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.
For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of
them whose heart
is
 perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.
Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for
he was in a rage with him because of this
thing. And Asa oppressed
some of the people the same time.
And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they
are
 written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease
was exceeding
great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.
And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.
And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds
of spices prepared by the apothecaries’ art: and they made a very great burning for him.

## Part 6: Divided Kingdom - Northern Israel

### Historical and Cultural Background: Divided Kingdom - Northern Israel

**Historical Context (Israel's Kings (~930-722 BCE))**

The Northern Kingdom of Israel existed for approximately 208 years (ca. 930-722 BCE) from Jeroboam I's secession through Assyrian conquest under Hoshea. The kingdom experienced persistent political instability: nine dynasties, multiple violent coups, and frequent regicide characterized northern politics. Archaeological and extra-biblical sources confirm the kingdom's historicity and major events. The Mesha Stele (ca. 840 BCE) provides Moabite perspective on conflicts with Israel's Omride dynasty. Assyrian annals extensively document interactions with Israel: Shalmaneser III's Monolith Inscription (853 BCE) mentions Ahab contributing substantial chariot forces to the anti-Assyrian coalition at Qarqar; the Black Obelisk depicts Jehu paying tribute (841 BCE); Tiglath-pileser III records receiving tribute from Menahem (738 BCE); Shalmaneser V and Sargon II describe Israel's conquest (724-722 BCE). The kingdom's end came through Assyrian military campaigns: Tiglath-pileser III annexed northern territories (734-732 BCE), and Shalmaneser V/Sargon II destroyed Samaria after three-year siege (724-722 BCE), deporting substantial population (27,290 according to Sargon's annals). Iron Age IIB-C (1000-586 BCE) archaeologically, this period shows significant urbanization, monumental architecture, administrative complexity, and eventual violent destruction. The northern kingdom often exceeded Judah in population, territory, agricultural productivity, and international significance, though biblical sources present negative theological evaluation due to persistent non-Yahwistic worship.

**Geographic Setting**

The Northern Kingdom of Israel encompassed the territories of ten northern tribes (all except Judah and Benjamin), stretching from Dan in the far north to Bethel in the south, from the Mediterranean coast (though Philistine cities remained independent) eastward across the Jordan into Gilead. Major cities included: Shechem (Jeroboam I's initial capital), Tirzah (capital until Omri), Samaria (Omri's new capital ca. 880 BCE, remaining capital until 722 BCE), Jezreel (royal residence and secondary center), Dan and Bethel (royal sanctuary cities with golden calves), Megiddo, Hazor, and Gezer (fortified administrative centers). The territory featured diverse geography: the fertile Jezreel Valley (key agricultural zone), Samarian hill country (capital region), Jordan Valley, Galilee highlands, and Transjordanian plateau (Gilead). This geography provided superior agricultural productivity compared to Judah's arid highlands—abundant grain production, extensive viticulture, olive cultivation, and livestock supported larger population and economy. The kingdom controlled major trade routes: the Via Maris (coastal highway connecting Egypt and Mesopotamia) passed through its territory, and the Transjordanian King's Highway connected Arabia with Damascus. Proximity to Phoenicia enabled economic partnership, particularly during Omride dynasty (Ahab's marriage to Phoenician princess Jezebel). However, geography also created vulnerability: unlike Judah's relative isolation in hill country, Israel's position along major routes exposed it to international military campaigns, particularly Assyrian expansion.

**Cultural Context**

Northern Kingdom culture reflected Canaanite continuity and internationalization more than Judah. Urban centers like Samaria displayed cosmopolitan character with Phoenician artistic influences evident in "ivory house" decorations (1 Kings 22:39, confirmed by archaeological Samaria ivories showing Phoenician style). Social stratification increased substantially: royal house, aristocracy, merchants, artisans, farmers, and growing dispossessed class. The prophetic critique of social injustice—Amos denouncing the wealthy who "trample the head of the poor" (Amos 2:7), "sell the righteous for silver" (2:6), Hosea condemning exploitation (12:7-8)—reveals economic inequality. Large estates developed as landed aristocracy accumulated property, dispossessing small farmers. Ostraca from Samaria (8th century BCE) document wine and oil taxation/trade, revealing administrative complexity. Architecture shows wealth concentration: elaborate palaces, fine ashlar masonry, proto-Aeolic capitals. Family structure maintained patriarchal patterns, though royal polygamy for diplomatic alliance differed from peasant monogamy. Literacy increased with bureaucratic needs, though remained limited to elite scribal class. Cultural practices included Canaanite agricultural festivals adapted to Yahweh worship, though often syncretistically. Baal worship, promoted particularly by Jezebel and Ahab, integrated Phoenician religious elements. The prophetic movement emerged powerfully in the north—Elijah, Elisha, Amos, Hosea—challenging both religious syncretism and social injustice. The northern tribes maintained distinct identity from Judah, tension visible in Rehoboam's assembly at Shechem where northern elders demanded relief from Solomonic burdens.

**Political Context**

Northern Kingdom politics proved chronically unstable, contrasting sharply with Judah's continuous Davidic dynasty. Nine distinct dynasties ruled in 208 years: Jeroboam I's brief dynasty (930-909 BCE, two kings), Baasha's dynasty (909-885 BCE, two kings), Omri's dynasty (885-841 BCE, four kings—most stable and internationally significant), Jehu's dynasty (841-752 BCE, five kings—longest dynasty), followed by rapid succession and assassinations. Coups and regicide occurred frequently: Baasha killed Nadab, Zimri killed Elah, Omri defeated Zimri, Jehu killed Joram and Jezebel, Shallum killed Zechariah, Menahem killed Shallum, Pekah killed Pekahiah, Hoshea killed Pekah. This instability contrasted with stable succession in Assyria and Egypt. International relations dominated politics. The Omride dynasty (Omri and Ahab) achieved significant power: Omri built new capital at Samaria, established Phoenician alliance (Ahab-Jezebel marriage), and the kingdom became regionally significant—Assyrian records thereafter referred to Israel as "House of Omri" (Bit-Humri) even after dynasty's fall. Ahab joined anti-Assyrian coalition contributing 2,000 chariots and 10,000 infantry at Qarqar (853 BCE). However, conflicts with Aram-Damascus remained persistent threat. Jehu's revolt (841 BCE) and Omride dynasty destruction brought Phoenician alliance end and submission to Assyria (Black Obelisk tribute). Jeroboam II's reign (786-746 BCE) saw territorial expansion and prosperity during Assyrian weakness, but Tiglath-pileser III's resurgence (745 BCE) initiated Israel's end: Menahem paid massive tribute (738 BCE), Pekah's anti-Assyrian coalition led to territory annexation (734-732 BCE), and Hoshea's rebellion prompted final siege and conquest (724-722 BCE).

**Economic Context**

The Northern Kingdom possessed superior economic resources compared to Judah. Agriculture formed the foundation: the fertile Jezreel Valley, Sharon Plain, and northern regions produced abundant wheat, barley, olives, grapes, and figs. The Samaria ostraca (8th century BCE) document extensive wine and oil production and distribution, revealing sophisticated agricultural administration and taxation. Livestock raising (sheep, goats, cattle) flourished in hill country and Transjordan. Economic activities included specialized industries: textiles, pottery, metallurgy (copper and iron working), olive oil production, and wine production. Trade provided significant revenue: control of Via Maris and King's Highway meant transit tolls, and partnership with Phoenicia (particularly during Omride period) enabled maritime commerce. Phoenician alliance brought economic benefits—Ahab's "ivory house" (1 Kings 22:39) reflects luxury imports. The wealthy class emerged, visible archaeologically in elaborate houses, fine pottery, and luxury items. Social stratification intensified: wealthy landowners accumulated estates while small farmers lost ancestral lands through debt, creating the dispossessed class prophets denounced. Taxation supported royal administration, military, building projects, and tribute to foreign powers. Tribute payments were substantial: Menahem extracted 50 shekels per wealthy man to pay 1,000 talents to Tiglath-pileser III (2 Kings 15:19-20), indicating significant wealth concentration. Markets and commerce flourished in urban centers. However, economic prosperity proved unevenly distributed, creating social tensions prophets addressed. The kingdom's end brought economic devastation: Assyrian conquest meant tribute extraction, population deportation, land redistribution, and economic integration into Assyrian provincial system.

**Religious Context**

Religious practice in the Northern Kingdom combined Yahweh worship with Canaanite elements, creating the syncretism biblical sources condemn. Jeroboam I's religious innovations at kingdom founding (1 Kings 12:26-33) included: golden calf installations at Dan and Bethel (northern and southern sanctuary cities), non-Levitical priesthood, altered festival calendar. The Deuteronomistic History interprets these as apostasy ("the sin of Jeroboam"), though Jeroboam likely intended the calves as Yahweh's throne or pedestal (like cherubim in Jerusalem temple) rather than separate deities. However, the symbols inevitably confused with Canaanite bull imagery associated with Baal. The Omride period saw intensified Baal worship, particularly under Jezebel's influence, with Baal temple in Samaria and persecution of Yahweh prophets, prompting Elijah's confrontation on Mount Carmel. Asherah worship remained popular, evident in archaeological finds of goddess figurines and references to "Yahweh and his Asherah" in contemporary inscriptions. High places (bāmôt) proliferated throughout the kingdom for local worship. The northern prophetic movement responded vigorously: Elijah confronted Ahab and Baal worship, Elisha continued prophetic opposition, Amos condemned social injustice and empty ritualism, Hosea used marriage metaphor to depict Israel's unfaithfulness and called for covenant loyalty. Popular religion likely mixed Yahweh worship with Canaanite practices, agricultural festivals, and fertility cult elements. Archaeological evidence from Dan shows cult site with elaborate installations. The religious situation reflected broader struggle between exclusive Yahwism and Canaanite religious integration. Biblical sources uniformly condemn northern kings for religious failures, interpreting Assyrian conquest as divine judgment for persistent covenant violation. Theologically, the north's destruction validated Deuteronomistic claims that centralized Jerusalem worship represented the only legitimate sanctuary and that apostasy brings covenant curse.

### 1 Kings Chapter 3

And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.
And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that
was
 the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as
it is
 this day.
And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I
am but a little child: I know not
how
 to go out or come in.
And thy servant
is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?
And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.
And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.
And Solomon awoke; and, behold,
it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
Then came there two women,
that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.
And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we
were together;
there was
 no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.
And the other woman said, Nay; but the living
is my son, and the dead
is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead
is
 thy son, and the living
is my son. Thus they spake before the king.
Then said the king, The one saith, This
is my son that liveth, and thy son
is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son
is the dead, and my son
is the living.
And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
Then spake the woman whose the living child
was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine,
but divide
it.
Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she
is the mother thereof.
And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God
was in him, to do judgment.


### 1 Kings Chapter 4

So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
And these
were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,
Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar
were the priests:
And Azariah the son of Nathan
was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan
was principal officer,
and the king’s friend:
And Ahishar
was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda
was over the tribute.
And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.
And these
are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:
The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan:
The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him
pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:
The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
Baana the son of Ahilud;
to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah,
even unto
the place that is beyond Jokneam:
The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him
pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which
are in Gilead; to him
also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars:
Ahinadab the son of Iddo
had Mahanaim:
Ahimaaz
was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
Baanah the son of Hushai
was in Asher and in Aloth:
Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:
Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:
Geber the son of Uri
was in the country of Gilead,
in
 the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and
he was the only officer which
was in the land.
Judah and Israel
were many, as the sand which
is
 by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.
And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,
Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.
For he had dominion over all
the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.
And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.
Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where
the officers were, every man according to his charge.
And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that
is on the sea shore.
And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.
And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that
is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.
And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.


### 1 Kings Chapter 5

And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side,
so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.
Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that
there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.
And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed
be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.
And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for:
and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
My servants shall bring
them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive
them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees
according to
 all his desire.
And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat
for
 food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon,
and two months at home: and Adoniram
was over the levy.
And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;
Beside the chief of Solomon’s officers which
were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.
And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones,
and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.
And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew
them,
 and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.

### 1 Kings Chapter 6

And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which
is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof
was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty
cubits,
 and the height thereof thirty cubits.
And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits
was
 the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house;
and
 ten cubits
was the breadth thereof before the house.
And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
against the walls of the house round about,
both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:
The nethermost chamber
was five cubits broad, and the middle
was six cubits broad, and the third
was seven cubits broad: for without
in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that
the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe
nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
The door for the middle chamber
was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle
chamber,
 and out of the middle into the third.
So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
And
then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house
with timber of cedar.
And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,
Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:
And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling:
and he covered
them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built
them for it within,
even for the oracle,
even for the most holy
place.
And the house, that
is, the temple before it, was forty cubits
long.
And the cedar of the house within
was carved with knops and open flowers: all
was cedar; there was no stone seen.
And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
And the oracle in the forepart
was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar
which was of
 cedar.
So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that
was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.
And within the oracle he made two cherubims
of olive tree,
each ten cubits high.
And five cubits
was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other
were ten cubits.
And the other cherub
was ten cubits: both the cherubims
were of one measure and one size.
The height of the one cherub
was ten cubits, and so
was it of the other cherub.
And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the
one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.
And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
And for the entering of the oracle he made doors
of olive tree: the lintel
and side posts
were a fifth part
of the wall.
The two doors also
were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid
them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.
So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part
of the wall.
And the two doors
were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door
were folding, and the two leaves of the other door
were
 folding.
And he carved
thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered
them with gold fitted upon the carved work.
And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.
In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:
And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which
is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.


### 1 Kings Chapter 7

But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof
was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
And
it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that
lay on forty five pillars, fifteen
in a row.
And
there were windows
in three rows, and light
was against light
in three ranks.
And all the doors and posts
were square, with the windows: and light
was against light
in three ranks.
And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof
was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the
other pillars and the thick beam
were before them.
Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge,
even
 the porch of judgment: and
it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
And his house where he dwelt
had another court within the porch,
which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken
to wife, like unto this porch.
All these
were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.
And the foundation
was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
And above
were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.
And the great court round about
was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.
And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
He
was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father
was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.
And he made two chapiters
of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter
was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter
was five cubits:
And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which
were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.
And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that
were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.
And the chapiters that
were upon the top of the pillars
were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.
And the chapiters upon the two pillars
had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which
was by the network: and the pomegranates
were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.
And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and he called the name thereof Boaz.
And upon the top of the pillars
was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other:
it was round all about, and his height
was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
And under the brim of it round about
there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops
were cast in two rows, when it was cast.
It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea
was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts
were inward.
And it
was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.
And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits
was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.
And the work of the bases
was on this
manner: they had borders, and the borders
were between the ledges:
And on the borders that
were between the ledges
were
 lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges
there was
 a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen
were certain additions made of thin work.
And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver
were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.
And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above
was a cubit: but the mouth thereof
was round
after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it
were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.
And under the borders
were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels
were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel
was a cubit and a half a cubit.
And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes,
were
 all molten.
And
there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base:
and the undersetters
were of the very base itself.
And in the top of the base
was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof
were of the same.
For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.
After this
manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure,
and one size.
Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths:
and every laver was four cubits:
and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.
And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.
And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:
The two pillars, and the
two bowls of the chapiters that
were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which
were upon the top of the pillars;
And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks,
even
 two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that
were upon the pillars;
And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD,
were of
 bright brass.
In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.
And Solomon left all the vessels
unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.
And Solomon made all the vessels that
pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread
was,
And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right
side,
 and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs
of gold,
And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers
of pure gold; and the hinges
of gold,
both
 for the doors of the inner house, the most holy
place, and
 for the doors of the house,
to wit, of the temple.
So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated;
even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.


### 1 Kings Chapter 8

Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which
is Zion.
And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which
is the seventh month.
And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that
were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.
And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that
were
 assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy
place, even
 under the wings of the cherubims.
For the cherubims spread forth
their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy
place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.
There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made
a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,
So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.
Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in thick darkness.
I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.
And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)
And he said, Blessed
be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled
it, saying,
Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.
Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.
And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein
is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:
And he said, LORD God of Israel,
there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:
Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled
it with thine hand, as
it is this day.
Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.
And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.
But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?
Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:
That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day,
even
 toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.
And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.
If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:
Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:
Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.
When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:
Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust,
or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness
there be;
What prayer and supplication soever be
made by any man,
or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:
Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou,
even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)
That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
Moreover concerning a stranger, that
is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name’s sake;
(For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;
Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as
do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.
If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and
toward the house that I have built for thy name:
Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
If they sin against thee, (for
there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;
Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;
And
so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:
Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,
And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:
For they
be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:
That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.
For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth,
to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.
And it was
so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.
And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
Blessed
be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.
The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:
That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.
And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:
That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD
is
 God,
and that there is none else.
Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.
And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.
The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that
was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that
was before the LORD
was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.
And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days,
even fourteen days.
On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.


### 1 Kings Chapter 9

And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which he was pleased to do,
That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.
And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.
And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee,
and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:
Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments
and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:
Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:
And at this house,
which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?
And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.
And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king’s house,
(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.
And he said, What cities
are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.
And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.
And this
is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it
for a present unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife.
And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,
and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,
And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
And all the people
that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which
were not of the children of Israel,
Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.
But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they
were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.
These
were the chief of the officers that
were
 over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.
But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which
Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.
And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that
was before the LORD. So he finished the house.
And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.
And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought
it to king Solomon.


### 1 Kings Chapter 10

And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.
And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not
any
 thing hid from the king, which he told her not.
And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and the house that he had built,
And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen
it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.
Happy
are thy men, happy
are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee,
and that hear thy wisdom.
Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.
And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.
And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.
And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside
that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold.
Beside
that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred
shekels of gold went to one target.
And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.
The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne
was round behind: and
there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.
And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels
were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon
were of pure gold; none
were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.
And the king made silver
to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he
to be as the sycomore trees that
are in the vale, for abundance.
And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
shekels
 of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring
them
 out by their means.

## 2 Kings

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** 2 Kings continues the narrative from 1 Kings, covering Israelite and Judean history from King Ahaziah of Israel (c. 853 BCE) through Judah's Babylonian exile (586 BCE), spanning approximately 270 years. The book chronicles the northern kingdom of Israel's final century under successive dynasties until Assyrian conquest and deportation (722/721 BCE), and the southern kingdom of Judah's survival for another 136 years until Babylonian destruction (586 BCE). Key historical markers include: Elisha's prophetic ministry (mid-9th century BCE), Jehu's bloody coup establishing a new Israelite dynasty (841 BCE), Israel's fall to Shalmaneser V and Sargon II of Assyria (722/721 BCE), Hezekiah's reign in Judah with Assyrian crisis (701 BCE siege by Sennacherib), Josiah's reforms discovering the "Book of the Law" (likely Deuteronomy, 622 BCE), and Judah's final collapse under Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon (597 BCE first deportation, 586 BCE Jerusalem's destruction). The book's composition is debated: traditionally attributed to Jeremiah or his circle, modern scholarship identifies it as part of the Deuteronomistic History (Joshua-2 Kings) compiled during the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) from earlier sources including court chronicles, prophetic traditions, and temple records, with final editing occurring after 562 BCE (the book's latest date, mentioning Jehoiachin's release from Babylonian prison, 2 Kings 25:27-30). Archaeological evidence extensively corroborates 2 Kings' historical framework through Assyrian and Babylonian records, though interpretive debates continue regarding specific events and theological assessments.

**Author and Audience:** 2 Kings' authorship follows 1 Kings as part of the unified Deuteronomistic History. Ancient tradition (Babylonian Talmud, Baba Batra 15a) attributes authorship to Jeremiah the prophet, given his eyewitness experience of Judah's fall and his association with the scribe Baruch. However, the anonymous compiler(s) clearly worked from multiple sources explicitly cited: "the book of the annals of the kings of Israel" (referenced 17 times for northern kings) and "the book of the annals of the kings of Judah" (referenced 15 times for southern kings), indicating official court chronicles. Prophetic sources also contributed, particularly traditions about Elisha (extensive miracle narratives, 2 Kings 2-8, 13) and Isaiah (Hezekiah narratives, chs. 18-20). The Deuteronomistic editor(s) compiled these sources during the Babylonian exile (c. 560-550 BCE based on final verses about Jehoiachin), writing for exiled Judeans seeking to understand their catastrophic national loss. The theological message addresses why Israel and Judah fell: persistent covenant violation, idolatry, failure to heed prophetic warnings, and divine judgment according to Deuteronomic standards. The audience—exiled Jews in Babylon—needed theological explanation for the temple's destruction and Davidic kingship's apparent failure despite divine promises. The Deuteronomistic framework provides this: not divine weakness but covenant justice. Yet the book's hopeful conclusion (Jehoiachin's elevation, 25:27-30) hints at possible restoration, maintaining hope in exile. The repetitive formulaic judgments of kings ("he did evil/right in the eyes of the LORD") reflect Deuteronomic theology evaluating rulers by cult centralization, exclusive Yahwism, and prophetic obedience.

**Key Themes:** 2 Kings develops several interwoven theological themes explaining Israel and Judah's demise while preserving hope. **Prophetic authority and divine word fulfillment** dominates: Elijah's translation (ch. 2) and Elisha's succession establish prophetic authority. Prophecies consistently come to pass—Elisha's predictions, Isaiah's promises to Hezekiah, warnings to Israel and Judah all prove true, validating prophetic word. **Covenant faithfulness versus idolatry** provides the evaluative standard: every king is judged by whether he removed high places, followed David's example, and eliminated foreign worship. Israel's kings universally "did evil," following Jeroboam I's sin (golden calves at Dan and Bethel). Judah's kings show mixed records, with reformers Hezekiah and Josiah praised, yet most perpetuating high places and Canaanite practices. **Divine judgment and mercy** alternate: God sends prophets warning of judgment (2 Kings 17:13-14), exercises patience, but ultimately executes threatened punishment. Israel's fall (ch. 17) receives explicit theological explanation—covenant violation, idolatry, ignoring prophets. Judah receives temporary reprieve due to David's sake and reformers' efforts, but Manasseh's extreme evil (ch. 21) seals Judah's fate despite Josiah's reforms. **Royal inadequacy and prophetic sufficiency** contrasts human kingship's failure with divine word's reliability: even good kings (Hezekiah, Josiah) cannot prevent national judgment, yet prophets (Elijah, Elisha, Isaiah) wield true power through God's word. **Centralized worship** importance emerges: the temple at Jerusalem represents proper worship; high places and regional shrines, even to Yahweh, constitute apostasy. **Miraculous divine intervention** appears in Elisha's ministry (feeding, healing, military victories) and Hezekiah's deliverance (Assyrian angel death, 19:35), showing God's power transcends national catastrophe. **Hope in exile** glimmers through Jehoiachin's release, suggesting Davidic line continues and restoration remains possible.

**Archaeological Relevance:** 2 Kings enjoys extensive archaeological corroboration, particularly from Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian sources, making it one of the most historically verified biblical books. **Assyrian records** confirm Israelite and Judean kings and events: The **Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III** (858-824 BCE) depicts "Jehu son of Omri" paying tribute (841 BCE), providing the earliest extra-biblical image of an Israelite king. **Assyrian annals** document Israelite kings: Ahab (853 BCE, Battle of Qarqar), Jehu (tribute payer), Menahem (paying tribute to Tiglath-Pileser III), Pekah and Hoshea. The **Assyrian Eponym Chronicle** confirms Israel's fall (722/721 BCE) under Shalmaneser V and Sargon II, who boasts deporting 27,290 Israelites. **Sennacherib's Prism** (701 BCE) describes besieging 46 Judean cities, trapping Hezekiah "like a bird in a cage" in Jerusalem—correlating with 2 Kings 18-19 though Sennacherib omits the siege's failure mentioned biblically. **Lachish reliefs** from Sennacherib's palace depict the siege of Judah's second city, matching the biblical account. The **Siloam Tunnel inscription** in Jerusalem describes Hezekiah's water tunnel construction preparing for siege (2 Kings 20:20). **Babylonian Chronicles** document Judah's fall: the capture of Jerusalem (597 BCE) under Jehoiachin, tribute collection, and Zedekiah's appointment as puppet king. The **Lachish Letters** (ostraca from 588/587 BCE) show final days before Babylon's conquest. **Seals and bullae** from this period include impressions reading "belonging to Hezekiah," various officials mentioned in 2 Kings, and "LMLK" (meaning "belonging to the king") jar handles from Hezekiah's administrative reorganization. The **Tel Dan Stele** references the "house of David," confirming the Davidic dynasty's historical existence. Archaeological destruction layers at Jerusalem, Lachish, and numerous Judean sites date to 586 BCE, confirming Babylonian destruction's extent.

**Structure:** 2 Kings contains 25 chapters organized chronologically following Israel's and Judah's parallel histories after Solomon's kingdom division, concluding with both kingdoms' falls. **Part I: Elisha's Ministry and Concurrent Reigns (1:1-10:36):** Chapters 1-2 transition from Elijah to Elisha; chapters 3-8 recount Elisha's extensive miracle ministry (healing Naaman, floating ax head, feeding multitudes, military prophecies); chapters 9-10 describe Jehu's violent coup, executing Ahab's house and Jezebel, fulfilling Elijah's prophecies, establishing a new Israelite dynasty. **Part II: Israel's Decline and Fall (11:1-17:41):** Alternates between Israelite and Judean kings following synchronistic chronology ("In the Xth year of King Y of Judah, King Z began to reign over Israel..."). Chronicles Israel's final unstable decades—multiple coups, assassinations, dynasties—culminating in Assyrian conquest (722/721 BCE, ch. 17) with theological explanation: Israel rejected God's covenant, followed idols, ignored prophets, therefore deserved exile. The Assyrian resettlement policy bringing foreign peoples to Samaria created the mixed population later called Samaritans. **Part III: Judah Alone—Reform and Decline (18:1-25:30):** Focuses on Judah's survival after Israel's fall. Chapters 18-20 detail Hezekiah's reforms (removing high places, destroying bronze serpent, centralizing worship) and Assyrian crisis (Sennacherib's siege, miraculous deliverance, 185,000 Assyrian soldiers struck dead). Chapters 21-23 contrast Manasseh's extreme evil (reversing Hezekiah's reforms, filling Jerusalem with innocent blood, sealing Judah's doom) with Josiah's thorough reform (finding the Book of the Law, celebrating Passover, destroying all idolatrous sites from Dan to Beersheba)—yet divine judgment remains irrevocable. Chapters 24-25 chronicle Judah's final collapse: Jehoiachin's brief reign and surrender (597 BCE first deportation), Zedekiah's rebellion and catastrophic consequences (586 BCE Jerusalem's destruction, temple burning, wall demolition, mass deportation). The book concludes (25:27-30) with Jehoiachin's release from Babylonian prison (562 BCE), a glimmer of hope suggesting the Davidic line continues.

### 2 Kings Chapter 11

And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.
But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king’s sons
which were
 slain; and they hid him,
even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.
And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land.
And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king’s son.
And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;
And a third part
shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.
And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.
And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.
And the captains over the hundreds did according to all
things
 that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David’s spears and shields, that
were in the temple of the LORD.
And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple,
along by the altar and the temple.
And he brought forth the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and
gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.
And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard
and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.
And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner
was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.
But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.
And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king’s house: and there was she slain.
And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people that they should be the LORD’S people; between the king also and the people.
And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.
And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.
And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword
beside the king’s house.
Seven years old
was Jehoash when he began to reign.


### 2 Kings Chapter 12

In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
And Jehoash did
that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD,
even the money of every one that passeth
the account, the money that every man is set at,
and all the money that cometh into any man’s heart to bring into the house of the LORD,
Let the priests take
it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found.
But it was
so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the
other
 priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no
more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.
And the priests consented to receive no
more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.
But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money
that was brought into the house of the LORD.
And it was
so, when they saw that
there was much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD.
And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD,
And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair
it.
Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money
that was brought into the house of the LORD:
But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD.
Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.
The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests’.
Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold
that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king’s house, and sent
it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.
And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did,
are
 they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.
For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.


### 2 Kings Chapter 13

In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria,
and reigned seventeen years.
And he did
that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, all
their days.
And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.
(And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.
Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin,
but walked therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)
Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might,
are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.
In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria,
and reigned sixteen years.
And he did
that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin:
but he walked therein.
And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah,
are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows.
And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And he put his hand
upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king’s hands.
And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened
it.
 Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD’S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed
them.
And he said, Take the arrows. And he took
them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.
And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed
it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria
but thrice.
And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band
of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.
But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.
So Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead.
And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.


### 2 Kings Chapter 14

In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.
He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
And he did
that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did.
Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.
And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.
But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.
Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that
was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
was
 in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that
was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.
Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory
of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to
thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall,
even thou, and Judah with thee?
But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which
belongeth to Judah.
And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.
And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah,
are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
And the rest of the acts of Amaziah,
are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which
was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria,
and reigned
 forty and one years.
And he did
that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which
was of Gath-hepher.
For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel,
that it was very bitter: for
there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.
And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath,
which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
And Jeroboam slept with his fathers,
even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.


### 2 Kings Chapter 15

In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.
Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
And he did
that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done;
Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.
And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king’s son
was
 over the house, judging the people of the land.
And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did,
are
 they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.
And he did
that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they
are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
This
was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth
generation.
 And so it came to pass.
Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.
For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they
are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that
were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not
to him, therefore he smote
it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.
In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel,
and reigned ten years in Samaria.
And he did
that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
And Menahem exacted the money of Israel,
even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.
And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did,
are
 they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.
In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria,
and reigned two years.
And he did
that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king’s house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.
And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they
are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria,
and reigned twenty years.
And he did
that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.
And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.
And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they
are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.
Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
And he did
that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD.
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did,
are
 they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.
And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

### 2 Kings Chapter 16

In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
Twenty years old
was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not
that which was right in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.
But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.
And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome
him.
At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day.
So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I
am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.
And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent
it for
 a present to the king of Assyria.
And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried
the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.
And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that
was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.
And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made
it against king Ahaz came from Damascus.
And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.
and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar.
And he brought also the brasen altar, which
was before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.
And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king’s burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire
by.
Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that
were
 under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones.
And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king’s entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did,
are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.


### 2 Kings Chapter 17

In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.
And he did
that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.
And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as
he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor
by
 the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
For
so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.
And the children of Israel did secretly
those things that
were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:
And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as
did
 the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:
For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.
Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets,
and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments
and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.
And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that
were
 round about them,
concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.
And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images,
even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.
For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.
And the king of Assyria brought
men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed
them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.
And
so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there,
that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew
some of them.
Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.
Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.
Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put
them
 in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.
And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.
Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;
With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.
And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.
And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.
But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.
So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children’s children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.


### 2 Kings Chapter 18

Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,
that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also
was
 Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
And he did
that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.
He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.
He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor
any that were before him.
For he clave to the LORD,
and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.
And the LORD was with him;
and he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.
He smote the Philistines,
even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which
was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,
that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
And at the end of three years they took it:
even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that
is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor
by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:
Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant,
and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear
them, nor do
them.
Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.
And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
And Hezekiah gave
him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house.
At that time did Hezekiah cut off
the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and
from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field.
And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which
was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
And Rab-shakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
Thou sayest, (but
they are but vain words,)
I have
 counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed,
even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.
But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God:
is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand
it: and talk not with us in the Jews’ language in the ears of the people that
are on the wall.
But Rab-shakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words?
hath he not
sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you.
Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:
Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:
Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make
an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and
then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:
Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.
Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
Where
are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where
are
 the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?
Who
are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?
But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which
was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with
their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.

## Hosea

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Hosea prophesied in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during its final turbulent decades before Assyrian conquest (c. 755-722 BCE). The superscription (1:1) dates his ministry to the reigns of Judean kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, and Israelite king Jeroboam II, though his primary activity likely spanned 750-725 BCE. Hosea witnessed Israel's political instability during this period: after Jeroboam II's death (746 BCE), Israel experienced rapid dynastic turnover with six kings in its final 25 years, including four coups and three assassinations (2 Kings 15-17). The prophet's ministry contextualized this chaos within covenant infidelity, using his own marriage to Gomer as a living parable of Yahweh's relationship with unfaithful Israel. Hosea's prophecies anticipated the Assyrian conquest: Tiglath-Pileser III's campaigns (734-732 BCE) reduced Israel to a rump state, and Shalmaneser V/Sargon II destroyed Samaria after a three-year siege (725-722 BCE, 2 Kings 17:3-6). Hosea is the only writing prophet from the Northern Kingdom, providing unique insider perspective on Israel's final crisis.

**Author and Audience:** Traditional attribution identifies Hosea son of Beeri (1:1) as author, a Northern Israelite prophet whose family life became prophetic sign. Unlike southern contemporaries Isaiah and Micah who addressed Jerusalem, Hosea spoke primarily to the Northern Kingdom ("Ephraim" appears 37 times, "Israel" 43 times), though the book was preserved and edited in Judah after 722 BCE (explaining Judean king lists and positive Judah references like 1:7, 3:5). Hosea's northern dialect and intimate knowledge of Israel's geography, politics, and cult practices confirm his Israelite origin. His marriage to Gomer "the wife of whoredom" (1:2) and their children's symbolic names (Jezreel, Lo-Ruhamah "Not-Pitied", Lo-Ammi "Not-My-People") enacted the broken covenant relationship. Scholars debate whether Gomer was a cult prostitute or became adulterous after marriage, and whether chapters 1 and 3 describe the same woman or two different marriages. The book's final form likely underwent Judean redaction after Samaria's fall, adding hope oracles (especially ch. 14) and Judah-positive material, though the core message of covenant love (hesed) betrayed by syncretism remains authentically Hosean.

**Key Themes:** **Covenant Love (Hesed)**: Hosea introduces marriage as metaphor for the Yahweh-Israel covenant, with Israel's Baal worship depicted as spiritual adultery. God's faithful love contrasts with Israel's fickle devotion (6:4). **Religious Syncretism**: Israel's worship mixed Yahwism with Canaanite Baal fertility religion, attributing grain, wine, and oil to Baal rather than Yahweh (2:5-8). Hosea condemns cult prostitution, sacred poles (asherim), calf worship at Bethel and Dan, and sacrifices at unauthorized high places. **Knowledge of God**: Hosea emphasizes "knowledge of God" (da'at elohim) over ritual sacrifice (6:6, quoted by Jesus in Matthew 9:13, 12:7). Israel's leaders – priests, prophets, kings – fail to teach true covenant loyalty, producing moral decay. **Divine Pathos**: God's emotional struggle appears throughout: torn between just judgment and redemptive love (11:8-9), experiencing Israel's betrayal as personal betrayal. The book presents God's "internal dialogue" wrestling with covenant demands versus parental compassion. **Judgment and Hope**: While announcing inevitable judgment (exile), Hosea promises eventual restoration when Israel returns to seek "the LORD their God, and David their king" (3:5), their "heart of stone" replaced by faithful devotion (14:4-7).

**Archaeological Relevance:** Hosea's 8th century BCE Northern Kingdom context receives extensive archaeological corroboration. **Samaria Ostraca** (administrative pottery inscriptions from Samaria, c. 780-770 BCE) document the wine and oil economy Hosea references (2:8-9, 7:14) and contain personal names with Baal elements (Abibaʿal "Baal is my father"), confirming widespread Baal syncretism. **Tel Dan** excavations revealed an elaborate cultic center with horned altar and bamah (high place), illustrating the northern sanctuary system Hosea condemns alongside Bethel (Dan and Bethel housed Jeroboam I's golden calves, 1 Kings 12:28-29). **Assyrian Records** chronicle Israel's collapse: the **Tiglath-Pileser III annals** document his 734-732 BCE campaigns reducing Israel to tributary status, and the **Sargon II annals** claim credit for Samaria's fall (though it likely fell to his predecessor Shalmaneser V), boasting "I besieged and conquered Samaria, led away as booty 27,290 inhabitants." **Lachish Letter IV** (from Judah, c. 587 BCE) references "the prophet" with negative connotation, reflecting growing suspicion of prophetic messages – a trajectory beginning with rejection of prophets like Hosea (9:7-8). **Israelite Cult Figurines**: Hundreds of female figurines ("pillar figurines") from Iron Age II sites illustrate popular fertility religion, likely connected to asherah worship Hosea attacks. The **Kuntillet Ajrud inscriptions** (Sinai, c. 800 BCE) mentioning "Yahweh and his Asherah" demonstrate the syncretistic pairing of Yahweh with a consort goddess, the exact practice Hosea combats.

**Structure:** Hosea's 14 chapters divide into two main sections. **Chapters 1-3: Symbolic Marriage Narrative** presents Hosea's marriage to Gomer as covenant metaphor: Chapter 1 narrates marriage and birth of three children with judgment names; Chapter 2 presents God's lawsuit (rîb) against unfaithful Israel, threatening wilderness exile before promising remarriage with restored fertility; Chapter 3 recounts purchasing/redeeming an adulteress (likely Gomer), symbolizing God's redemption of wayward Israel. **Chapters 4-14: Prophetic Oracles** deliver covenant lawsuit speeches alternating judgment and hope: 4:1-6:3 accuses priests of failing to teach knowledge of God, producing sexual immorality, violence, and social breakdown; 6:4-11:11 chronicles Israel's persistent covenant violations from wilderness period through monarchic betrayals, climaxing in God's anguished question "How can I give you up, Ephraim?" (11:8); 11:12-13:16 announces Assyrian judgment as consequence of covenant breaking; 14:1-9 concludes with repentance call and restoration promise if Israel forsakes idols and returns exclusively to Yahweh. The book's literary style features dense Hebrew poetry, wordplays (e.g., beth-aven "house of wickedness" for Bethel "house of God," 4:15), rapid metaphor shifts (lion, moth, dew, cypress), and emotional intensity reflecting divine pathos. Hosea profoundly influenced later prophets (Jeremiah especially) and New Testament theology (Matthew's repeated citation, Paul's use in Romans 9:25-26).

## Amos

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Amos prophesied during the prosperous reign of Jeroboam II of Israel (793-753 BCE) and Uzziah of Judah (792-740 BCE), placing his ministry around 760-750 BCE (1:1). This was Israel's zenith: territorial expansion, economic prosperity, and relative peace under Assyrian weakness after Adad-nirari III's death (783 BCE). Archaeological evidence confirms 8th century prosperity: monumental architecture at Samaria and Megiddo, luxury goods (ivory inlays at Samaria matching Amos 6:4), and extensive olive oil production. However, prosperity masked social decay that Amos condemned: judicial corruption (5:10-12), exploitation of the poor (2:6-7, 8:4-6), and religious complacency expressed through lavish but empty ritual (5:21-24). Amos's dating formula includes a reference to "two years before the earthquake" (1:1), an event so significant that Zechariah still remembered it generations later (Zech 14:5). Earthquake debris layers identified at Hazor, Gezer, Lachish, and other sites have been radiocarbon-dated to mid-8th century BCE, possibly correlating with Amos's reference. Amos was a contemporary of Hosea in the north and Isaiah/Micah in the south, part of the great 8th century prophetic movement addressing social injustice amid monarchic decline. His prophecies anticipated Assyrian conquest (Tiglath-Pileser III would campaign against Israel in 734-732 BCE, with final destruction in 722 BCE), though Amos speaks cryptically of an unnamed enemy from the north (6:14).

**Author and Audience:** Amos was a Judean from Tekoa (12 miles south of Jerusalem, 1:1), making him an outsider prophet who invaded the Northern Kingdom to deliver judgment oracles. He explicitly denies professional prophet status: "I am no prophet, nor a prophet's son, but I am a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs" (7:14), distancing himself from court prophets and cultic personnel. His occupation (noqed, "sheep breeder," 1:1; boqer, "herdsman," 7:14) suggests middle-class status rather than poverty – noqed elsewhere describes King Mesha of Moab (2 Kings 3:4). Amos's rural Judean background shaped his message: he knew agricultural cycles, animal husbandry, and the injustices small farmers faced from urban elites. He addressed the Northern Kingdom primarily, condemning Samaria's elite (4:1, 6:1), sanctuaries at Bethel (3:14, 5:5-6, 7:10-13) and Gilgal (4:4, 5:5), and predicting Israel's exile (7:17). His confrontation with Amaziah, priest of Bethel (7:10-17), resulted in expulsion from the northern sanctuary. The book was preserved in Judah after his expulsion, with possible Judean editing adding Judah oracles (2:4-5) and Davidic restoration promises (9:11-15), though the core social justice message and northern focus remain authentically Amosian. Amos pioneered social justice prophecy, influencing later prophets (Isaiah, Micah, Jeremiah) and Jesus's critique of religious formalism (Matthew 23).

**Key Themes:** **Divine Justice and Social Righteousness**: Amos's central message declares God demands justice (mishpat) and righteousness (tzedakah) over ritual worship: "Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream" (5:24, quoted by Martin Luther King Jr.). He condemns specific abuses: selling the righteous for silver and the poor for sandals (2:6, 8:6), trampling the poor (2:7, 5:11), taking bribes in the gate (5:12), using false scales and measures (8:5), debt slavery, and judicial corruption. **Covenant Accountability**: Israel's election by Yahweh (3:2, 9:7) increases rather than decreases accountability: "You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities" (3:2). Election theology cannot excuse injustice. **Empty Ritualism**: Amos savagely mocks Israel's enthusiastic worship at Bethel, Gilgal, and Beersheba (4:4-5, 5:21-23) – God "hates" and "despises" festivals, offerings, and songs when accompanied by oppression. Sacrifices without justice constitute rebellion. **Day of the LORD**: Amos subverts popular expectation that the "Day of the LORD" will bring Israel victory; instead, it will be "darkness, and not light" (5:18-20) – judgment on covenant unfaithfulness. **Oracles Against Nations**: Chapters 1-2 pronounce judgment on six surrounding nations (Damascus, Gaza, Tyre, Edom, Ammon, Moab) before climactically turning on Israel itself, demonstrating that Yahweh judges all nations by moral standards, but holds Israel especially accountable. **Visions of Judgment**: Five visions (7:1-9:4) escalate from averted judgment (locusts, fire) to inevitable doom (plumb line, summer fruit, altar destruction).

**Archaeological Relevance:** Amos's 8th century BCE context receives rich archaeological corroboration. **Samaria Excavations**: The **Samaria Ostraca** (pottery inscriptions documenting wine/oil shipments, c. 780-770 BCE) evidence the luxury economy Amos condemns; excavations revealed **ivory inlays** (from palace decorations) matching Amos's denunciation of "houses of ivory" and "beds of ivory" (3:15, 6:4), now displayed at the Israel Museum. **Tekoa**: Limited excavations confirm Amos's hometown existed in Iron Age II as an agricultural settlement specializing in sheep/goat husbandry. **Earthquake Evidence**: Mid-8th century BCE destruction layers at **Hazor** (Stratum VI), **Gezer**, **Lachish**, and other sites contain collapsed walls and jumbled debris consistent with seismic activity; radiocarbon dating and pottery chronology support c. 760 BCE date, matching "two years before the earthquake" (1:1). Some scholars identify this as a magnitude 8+ event based on destruction extent. **Assyrian Expansion**: **Tiglath-Pileser III's annals** document campaigns reducing Israel to tributary status (734-732 BCE), fulfilling Amos's warnings of northern invasion; the **Sargon II annals** claim credit for Samaria's final destruction (722 BCE), boasting of deporting 27,290 Israelites – the exile Amos foresaw (5:27, 7:11, 17). **Beersheba**: Excavations revealed a massive horned altar dismantled in late 8th century, possibly reflecting Hezekiah's or Josiah's reforms, illustrating the southern sanctuary Amos mentions (5:5, 8:14). **Social Stratification**: Iron Age II urban sites show increasing wealth disparity – elite residences ("four-room houses" expanding into multi-room complexes) versus deteriorating workers' quarters, archaeological evidence of the inequality Amos attacks.

**Structure:** Amos's 9 chapters follow a clear prophetic structure. **Chapters 1-2: Oracles Against the Nations** employ a numerical pattern ("For three transgressions... and for four") to pronounce judgment on Damascus (1:3-5), Gaza (1:6-8), Tyre (1:9-10), Edom (1:11-12), Ammon (1:13-15), Moab (2:1-3), Judah (2:4-5), and climactically Israel (2:6-16), whose oracle is longest and most detailed. This rhetorical strategy would have drawn Israelite audience agreement condemning enemies before turning the condemnation inward. **Chapters 3-6: Judgment Oracles Against Israel** present three "Hear this word" speeches (3:1, 4:1, 5:1) condemning Samaria's elite, empty worship, and social injustice, punctuated by the famous "Let justice roll down" declaration (5:24) and woe oracles against the complacent (6:1-7). Chapter 4 includes a satirical liturgy mocking Israel's pilgrimages and a catalogue of unanswered divine warnings (drought, famine, plague, earthquake) met with refrain "yet you did not return to me" (4:6-11). **Chapters 7:1-9:10: Five Visions** escalate judgment intensity: locusts (7:1-3, averted by intercession), fire (7:4-6, averted), plumb line (7:7-9, inevitable judgment), summer fruit (8:1-3, wordplay: qayitz "summer fruit" sounds like qetz "end"), and the LORD at the altar commanding total destruction (9:1-4). The visions frame Amos's conflict with Amaziah (7:10-17). **Chapter 9:11-15: Restoration Oracle** promises Davidic dynasty restoration and agricultural abundance, likely a later addition offering hope after judgment, though some defend Amosian authorship arguing prophets could hold judgment and hope in tension.

### Amos Chapter 2

Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away
the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:
But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting,
and with the sound of the trumpet:
And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away
the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:
But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away
the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;
That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the
same maid, to profane my holy name:
And they lay
themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.
Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height
was
 like the height of the cedars, and he
was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.
And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites.
Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.
But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.
Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed
that is
 full of sheaves.
Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:
Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and
he that is
 swift of foot shall not deliver
himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.
And
he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.


### Amos Chapter 3

Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,
You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.
Can two walk together, except they be agreed?
Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?
Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin
is
 for him? shall
one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?
Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done
it?
Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.
The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?
Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.
For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary
there shall be
 even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.
Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus
in
 a couch.
Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,
That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.
And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the LORD.


### Amos Chapter 4

Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that
are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.
The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.
And ye shall go out at the breaches, every
cow at that which is
 before her; and ye shall cast
them into the palace, saith the LORD.
Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning,
and your tithes after three years:
And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim
and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.
And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
And also I have withholden the rain from you, when
there were
 yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.
So two
or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured
them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
I have overthrown
some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel:
and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what
is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts,
is his name.


### Amos Chapter 5

Hear ye this word which I take up against you,
even a lamentation, O house of Israel.
The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land;
there is none to raise her up.
For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out
by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth
by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.
For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:
But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.
Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour
it, and
there be none to quench
it in Bethel.
Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,
Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD
is his name:
That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.
They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.
Forasmuch therefore as your treading
is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.
For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate
from their right.
Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it
is an evil time.
Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.
Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.
Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing
shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.
And in all vineyards
shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.
Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end
is
 it for you? the day of the LORD
is darkness, and not light.
As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
Shall not the day of the LORD
be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?
I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.
Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept
them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.
Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.
But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.
Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name
is The God of hosts.

### Amos Chapter 6

Woe to them
that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria,
which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!
Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines:
be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?
Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;
That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;
That chant to the sound of the viol,
and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;
That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.
Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.
The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.
And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.
And a man’s uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that
is
 by the sides of the house,
Is there yet
any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.
For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.
Shall horses run upon the rock? will
one plow
there
 with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:
Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?
But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.


### Amos Chapter 7

Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo,
it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings.
And it came to pass,
that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he
is small.
The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.
Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.
Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he
is small.
The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.
Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall
made
 by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.
And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:
And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.
For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:
But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it
is the king’s chapel, and it
is the king’s court.
Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I
was no prophet, neither
was I a prophet’s son; but I
was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:
And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.
Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not
thy word against the house of Isaac.
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.


### Amos Chapter 8

Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of summer fruit.
And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.
And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD:
there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast
them forth with silence.
Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,
Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?
That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes;
yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?
The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.
Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as
by the flood of Egypt.
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:
And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only
son,
 and the end thereof as a bitter day.
Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:
And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find
it.
In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.
They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beer-sheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.

## Part 7: Divided Kingdom - Southern Judah

### Historical and Cultural Background: Divided Kingdom - Southern Judah

**Historical Context (Judah's Kings (~930-586 BCE))**

The Southern Kingdom of Judah survived 344 years (ca. 930-586 BCE) from Rehoboam through Zedekiah, significantly longer than northern Israel's 208 years. Unlike the north's nine dynasties, Judah maintained continuous Davidic dynasty throughout its existence—twenty kings, all descendants of David. This political stability contrasted sharply with northern instability. Extra-biblical sources confirm Judah's existence and major events: Sennacherib's Prism describes the 701 BCE siege of Jerusalem during Hezekiah's reign, claiming capture of 46 fortified cities and 200,150 people; the Lachish reliefs depict Assyrian conquest of Judah's second city; Babylonian Chronicles document Nebuchadnezzar's campaigns against Jerusalem (597 and 586 BCE); the Babylonian ration lists mention Jehoiachin receiving provisions in exile. Archaeologically, this period corresponds to Iron Age IIB-C, showing urban development, fortification systems, administrative complexity, and ultimately violent destruction layers dated to Babylonian conquest. Judah experienced three major phases: early period of relative weakness overshadowed by northern Israel (930-722 BCE); middle period of expansion and prosperity following northern fall, particularly under Hezekiah and Josiah (722-609 BCE); and final period of decline under Babylonian domination ending in conquest and exile (609-586 BCE). The kingdom's survival 136 years beyond northern Israel validated Deuteronomistic theology attributing longevity to Davidic covenant and Jerusalem temple, though ultimately Judah too fell due to covenant unfaithfulness.

**Geographic Setting**

The Southern Kingdom of Judah consisted primarily of the tribal territories of Judah and Benjamin, significantly smaller and less agriculturally productive than northern Israel. The kingdom centered in the Judean highlands, a rugged, isolated region with limited water resources. Jerusalem, located on the border between Judah and Benjamin, served as political and religious capital throughout the kingdom's existence—unlike northern Israel's multiple capitals. Major cities included: Jerusalem (political/religious center), Lachish (second city, major fortress guarding Shephelah approaches), Hebron (ancient patriarchal city), Beersheba (southern fortress), Arad (southern border fortress), Mizpah (administrative center north of Jerusalem). The geography divided into distinct zones: the central Judean highlands (moderate rainfall, terraced agriculture, pastoralism), the Shephelah foothills (buffer zone between highlands and coastal plain, olive production, viticulture), the Negev (arid southern region, limited settlement, border fortresses), and the Judean wilderness (eastern desert descending to Dead Sea, minimal habitation). This geography provided defensive advantages—isolation and rugged terrain hindered invasion—but economic disadvantages compared to northern Israel's fertile valleys. Judah lacked direct Mediterranean coast access (Philistine cities controlled coast) and major trade routes passed through northern territory. However, Judah controlled approaches from Egypt through the Shephelah and southern trade routes through the Negev. The kingdom's smaller size and population (estimates suggest 1/3 to 1/4 of northern Israel's population) meant less economic and military power but greater internal cohesion.

**Cultural Context**

Judahite culture maintained stronger continuity with United Monarchy traditions than northern Israel, emphasizing Davidic dynasty, Jerusalem temple, and priestly establishment. Social structure remained stratified: royal house, priestly aristocracy (Zadokite high priests), court officials, landowners, merchants, artisans, farmers, and growing poor/dispossessed class. Archaeological evidence reveals increasing urbanization during Iron Age II: Jerusalem expanded beyond City of David to western hill, population estimates rising from few thousand to perhaps 25,000 by late 8th century following northern refugees after 722 BCE. The "Broad Wall" discovered in Jewish Quarter represents Hezekiah's fortification expansion. Lachish Level III shows sophisticated urban planning before Sennacherib's destruction. Literacy remained limited to elite scribal class, though the LMLK (lemelek, "belonging to the king") seal impressions on storage jars reveal administrative organization. The Siloam inscription (Hezekiah's tunnel project) demonstrates Hebrew literacy and engineering sophistication. Bullae (clay seal impressions) from City of David archives show official correspondence system. Family structure centered on patriarchal extended households (bêt 'āb), with women's status subordinate but varied by class—royal women wielded significant influence (queen mothers held official position as gebirah). Cultural practices included agricultural festivals (Passover, Weeks, Tabernacles) increasingly centralized in Jerusalem, particularly after Josiah's reforms (622 BCE). Prophetic movement flourished: Isaiah, Micah, Jeremiah, Zephaniah, Habakkuk challenged social injustice and religious syncretism. The discovery of silver amulets at Ketef Hinnom containing priestly blessing (Numbers 6:24-26) demonstrates religious practice continuity. Cultural identity emphasized election through Davidic Covenant and temple presence, distinguishing Judah from northern "apostasy."

**Political Context**

Judahite politics demonstrated remarkable stability through continuous Davidic dynasty, contrasting sharply with northern political chaos. The twenty Davidic kings included righteous reformers (Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, Josiah) and wicked idolaters (Ahaz, Manasseh), evaluated deuteronomistically by fidelity to exclusive Yahweh worship and temple centralization. Succession remained orderly—father to son—though occasional crises occurred (Athaliah's usurpation, 841-835 BCE, ending with Joash's restoration). International relations dominated Judah's political history in three phases. First phase (930-722 BCE): Judah remained weaker than northern Israel, sometimes vassal (under Omrides), sometimes allied, sometimes hostile. Egyptian pharaoh Shishak invaded ca. 925 BCE (confirmed by Shishak's list at Karnak temple). Second phase (722-609 BCE): Northern fall brought Judean expansion and prosperity. Hezekiah rebelled against Assyria (705-701 BCE), prompting Sennacherib's campaign—Lachish fell, Jerusalem besieged but survived (miraculous deliverance in biblical account; Assyrian account claims tribute extraction). Hezekiah's son Manasseh (697-642 BCE) submitted to Assyria, longest reign but condemned for idolatry. Josiah (640-609 BCE) implemented radical reforms during Assyrian decline, centralizing worship and expanding territory, but died confronting Egyptian Pharaoh Necho at Megiddo. Third phase (609-586 BCE): Neo-Babylonian dominance. Jehoiakim rebelled, prompting Nebuchadnezzar's first campaign (597 BCE)—partial deportation including King Jehoiachin. Zedekiah's rebellion triggered final siege (588-586 BCE)—Jerusalem destroyed, temple burned, mass deportation. The kingdom's end fulfilled prophetic warnings that covenant unfaithfulness brings covenant curse despite Davidic promises.

**Economic Context**

Judah's economy remained more modest than northern Israel's, based on subsistence agriculture in challenging terrain. The Judean highlands supported terraced viticulture, olive cultivation, fig production, and grain farming, though yields remained lower than northern fertile valleys. Pastoralism (sheep, goats) suited hill country terrain. The Shephelah foothills provided richer agricultural zone—olive oil production particularly important (remains of olive presses at Lachish, Tel Batash). Archaeological surveys reveal agricultural intensification during Iron Age II with terracing systems enabling cultivation on marginal lands. Wine and oil production generated trade goods—LMLK seal impressions on storage jars indicate centralized collection/distribution system for wine, oil, and grain, probably for royal administration, military supplies, and tribute payments. Economic activities included craft specialization: pottery production (distinctive Judean forms), metallurgy (copper and iron working), textile production, and luxury crafts for elite. Trade remained limited compared to northern kingdom—Judah lacked major route control until northern fall. However, southern trade routes through Negev to Arabia and Egypt provided some commercial opportunities. Tribute payments to Assyria and Babylon strained economy: Hezekiah paid 300 talents of silver and 30 talents of gold to Sennacherib (2 Kings 18:14-16). Economic inequality increased, prompting prophetic critique—Isaiah denounced those who "add house to house and join field to field" (5:8), Micah condemned those who "covet fields and seize them" (2:2). Archaeological evidence shows wealth concentration in Jerusalem and major cities versus modest rural settlements. The Babylonian destruction brought economic catastrophe: deportation of elite, destruction of urban centers, loss of political infrastructure, and land redistribution to "the poorest people of the land" (2 Kings 25:12).

**Religious Context**

Religious practice in Judah centered on Jerusalem temple and Davidic Covenant, distinguishing it theologically from northern "apostasy," though syncretism persisted until Josiah's reforms. The temple, built by Solomon and maintained (with occasional repairs—Joash, Josiah) throughout the monarchy, served as exclusive legitimate sanctuary according to Deuteronomic theology. Three annual pilgrimage festivals (Passover, Weeks, Tabernacles) drew population to Jerusalem. The Zadokite high priesthood maintained hereditary control over temple worship, conducting sacrificial rituals according to priestly traditions. However, high places (bāmôt) operated throughout the kingdom until Hezekiah (partially) and Josiah (more thoroughly) abolished them. The Arad temple in the Negev, featuring altar and holy of holies, operated until late 8th century (likely destroyed during Hezekiah's centralization). Popular religion mixed Yahweh worship with Canaanite elements: Asherah poles stood even in Jerusalem temple during various reigns (2 Kings 21:7; removed by reformers), goddess figurines appear archaeologically throughout Judean sites, and prophets condemned Baal worship and child sacrifice in the Valley of Hinnom. The prophetic movement powerfully challenged both religious syncretism and social injustice: Isaiah called for justice and denounced empty ritualism; Micah summarized true religion as "act justly, love mercy, walk humbly with your God" (6:8); Jeremiah warned that temple presence provides no protection without covenant faithfulness; Zephaniah announced coming judgment. Two major reform movements occurred: Hezekiah's reforms (late 8th century) following northern fall, and Josiah's reforms (622 BCE) following discovery of "the book of the law" (probably Deuteronomy), which centralized worship, destroyed high places, eliminated foreign altars, and purified temple. The Ketef Hinnom silver amulets (late 7th/early 6th century) containing priestly blessing demonstrate continued adherence to traditional worship forms. The Babylonian destruction and exile created theological crisis: temple destroyed, Davidic kingship ended, land lost—yet prophets interpreted exile as covenant judgment while maintaining hope for restoration through repentance. Post-exilic Judaism would emerge from this crisis, shaped by Deuteronomistic theology explaining exile as deserved punishment and maintaining hope through Davidic Covenant promises ultimately fulfilled messianically.

## 2 Kings

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** 2 Kings continues the narrative from 1 Kings, covering Israelite and Judean history from King Ahaziah of Israel (c. 853 BCE) through Judah's Babylonian exile (586 BCE), spanning approximately 270 years. The book chronicles the northern kingdom of Israel's final century under successive dynasties until Assyrian conquest and deportation (722/721 BCE), and the southern kingdom of Judah's survival for another 136 years until Babylonian destruction (586 BCE). Key historical markers include: Elisha's prophetic ministry (mid-9th century BCE), Jehu's bloody coup establishing a new Israelite dynasty (841 BCE), Israel's fall to Shalmaneser V and Sargon II of Assyria (722/721 BCE), Hezekiah's reign in Judah with Assyrian crisis (701 BCE siege by Sennacherib), Josiah's reforms discovering the "Book of the Law" (likely Deuteronomy, 622 BCE), and Judah's final collapse under Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon (597 BCE first deportation, 586 BCE Jerusalem's destruction). The book's composition is debated: traditionally attributed to Jeremiah or his circle, modern scholarship identifies it as part of the Deuteronomistic History (Joshua-2 Kings) compiled during the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) from earlier sources including court chronicles, prophetic traditions, and temple records, with final editing occurring after 562 BCE (the book's latest date, mentioning Jehoiachin's release from Babylonian prison, 2 Kings 25:27-30). Archaeological evidence extensively corroborates 2 Kings' historical framework through Assyrian and Babylonian records, though interpretive debates continue regarding specific events and theological assessments.

**Author and Audience:** 2 Kings' authorship follows 1 Kings as part of the unified Deuteronomistic History. Ancient tradition (Babylonian Talmud, Baba Batra 15a) attributes authorship to Jeremiah the prophet, given his eyewitness experience of Judah's fall and his association with the scribe Baruch. However, the anonymous compiler(s) clearly worked from multiple sources explicitly cited: "the book of the annals of the kings of Israel" (referenced 17 times for northern kings) and "the book of the annals of the kings of Judah" (referenced 15 times for southern kings), indicating official court chronicles. Prophetic sources also contributed, particularly traditions about Elisha (extensive miracle narratives, 2 Kings 2-8, 13) and Isaiah (Hezekiah narratives, chs. 18-20). The Deuteronomistic editor(s) compiled these sources during the Babylonian exile (c. 560-550 BCE based on final verses about Jehoiachin), writing for exiled Judeans seeking to understand their catastrophic national loss. The theological message addresses why Israel and Judah fell: persistent covenant violation, idolatry, failure to heed prophetic warnings, and divine judgment according to Deuteronomic standards. The audience—exiled Jews in Babylon—needed theological explanation for the temple's destruction and Davidic kingship's apparent failure despite divine promises. The Deuteronomistic framework provides this: not divine weakness but covenant justice. Yet the book's hopeful conclusion (Jehoiachin's elevation, 25:27-30) hints at possible restoration, maintaining hope in exile. The repetitive formulaic judgments of kings ("he did evil/right in the eyes of the LORD") reflect Deuteronomic theology evaluating rulers by cult centralization, exclusive Yahwism, and prophetic obedience.

**Key Themes:** 2 Kings develops several interwoven theological themes explaining Israel and Judah's demise while preserving hope. **Prophetic authority and divine word fulfillment** dominates: Elijah's translation (ch. 2) and Elisha's succession establish prophetic authority. Prophecies consistently come to pass—Elisha's predictions, Isaiah's promises to Hezekiah, warnings to Israel and Judah all prove true, validating prophetic word. **Covenant faithfulness versus idolatry** provides the evaluative standard: every king is judged by whether he removed high places, followed David's example, and eliminated foreign worship. Israel's kings universally "did evil," following Jeroboam I's sin (golden calves at Dan and Bethel). Judah's kings show mixed records, with reformers Hezekiah and Josiah praised, yet most perpetuating high places and Canaanite practices. **Divine judgment and mercy** alternate: God sends prophets warning of judgment (2 Kings 17:13-14), exercises patience, but ultimately executes threatened punishment. Israel's fall (ch. 17) receives explicit theological explanation—covenant violation, idolatry, ignoring prophets. Judah receives temporary reprieve due to David's sake and reformers' efforts, but Manasseh's extreme evil (ch. 21) seals Judah's fate despite Josiah's reforms. **Royal inadequacy and prophetic sufficiency** contrasts human kingship's failure with divine word's reliability: even good kings (Hezekiah, Josiah) cannot prevent national judgment, yet prophets (Elijah, Elisha, Isaiah) wield true power through God's word. **Centralized worship** importance emerges: the temple at Jerusalem represents proper worship; high places and regional shrines, even to Yahweh, constitute apostasy. **Miraculous divine intervention** appears in Elisha's ministry (feeding, healing, military victories) and Hezekiah's deliverance (Assyrian angel death, 19:35), showing God's power transcends national catastrophe. **Hope in exile** glimmers through Jehoiachin's release, suggesting Davidic line continues and restoration remains possible.

**Archaeological Relevance:** 2 Kings enjoys extensive archaeological corroboration, particularly from Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian sources, making it one of the most historically verified biblical books. **Assyrian records** confirm Israelite and Judean kings and events: The **Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III** (858-824 BCE) depicts "Jehu son of Omri" paying tribute (841 BCE), providing the earliest extra-biblical image of an Israelite king. **Assyrian annals** document Israelite kings: Ahab (853 BCE, Battle of Qarqar), Jehu (tribute payer), Menahem (paying tribute to Tiglath-Pileser III), Pekah and Hoshea. The **Assyrian Eponym Chronicle** confirms Israel's fall (722/721 BCE) under Shalmaneser V and Sargon II, who boasts deporting 27,290 Israelites. **Sennacherib's Prism** (701 BCE) describes besieging 46 Judean cities, trapping Hezekiah "like a bird in a cage" in Jerusalem—correlating with 2 Kings 18-19 though Sennacherib omits the siege's failure mentioned biblically. **Lachish reliefs** from Sennacherib's palace depict the siege of Judah's second city, matching the biblical account. The **Siloam Tunnel inscription** in Jerusalem describes Hezekiah's water tunnel construction preparing for siege (2 Kings 20:20). **Babylonian Chronicles** document Judah's fall: the capture of Jerusalem (597 BCE) under Jehoiachin, tribute collection, and Zedekiah's appointment as puppet king. The **Lachish Letters** (ostraca from 588/587 BCE) show final days before Babylon's conquest. **Seals and bullae** from this period include impressions reading "belonging to Hezekiah," various officials mentioned in 2 Kings, and "LMLK" (meaning "belonging to the king") jar handles from Hezekiah's administrative reorganization. The **Tel Dan Stele** references the "house of David," confirming the Davidic dynasty's historical existence. Archaeological destruction layers at Jerusalem, Lachish, and numerous Judean sites date to 586 BCE, confirming Babylonian destruction's extent.

**Structure:** 2 Kings contains 25 chapters organized chronologically following Israel's and Judah's parallel histories after Solomon's kingdom division, concluding with both kingdoms' falls. **Part I: Elisha's Ministry and Concurrent Reigns (1:1-10:36):** Chapters 1-2 transition from Elijah to Elisha; chapters 3-8 recount Elisha's extensive miracle ministry (healing Naaman, floating ax head, feeding multitudes, military prophecies); chapters 9-10 describe Jehu's violent coup, executing Ahab's house and Jezebel, fulfilling Elijah's prophecies, establishing a new Israelite dynasty. **Part II: Israel's Decline and Fall (11:1-17:41):** Alternates between Israelite and Judean kings following synchronistic chronology ("In the Xth year of King Y of Judah, King Z began to reign over Israel..."). Chronicles Israel's final unstable decades—multiple coups, assassinations, dynasties—culminating in Assyrian conquest (722/721 BCE, ch. 17) with theological explanation: Israel rejected God's covenant, followed idols, ignored prophets, therefore deserved exile. The Assyrian resettlement policy bringing foreign peoples to Samaria created the mixed population later called Samaritans. **Part III: Judah Alone—Reform and Decline (18:1-25:30):** Focuses on Judah's survival after Israel's fall. Chapters 18-20 detail Hezekiah's reforms (removing high places, destroying bronze serpent, centralizing worship) and Assyrian crisis (Sennacherib's siege, miraculous deliverance, 185,000 Assyrian soldiers struck dead). Chapters 21-23 contrast Manasseh's extreme evil (reversing Hezekiah's reforms, filling Jerusalem with innocent blood, sealing Judah's doom) with Josiah's thorough reform (finding the Book of the Law, celebrating Passover, destroying all idolatrous sites from Dan to Beersheba)—yet divine judgment remains irrevocable. Chapters 24-25 chronicle Judah's final collapse: Jehoiachin's brief reign and surrender (597 BCE first deportation), Zedekiah's rebellion and catastrophic consequences (586 BCE Jerusalem's destruction, temple burning, wall demolition, mass deportation). The book concludes (25:27-30) with Jehoiachin's release from Babylonian prison (562 BCE), a glimmer of hope suggesting the Davidic line continues.

### 2 Kings Chapter 1

Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that
was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.
But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them,
Is it
 not because
there is not a God in Israel,
that
 ye go to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?
Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.
And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?
And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
Is it not because
there is not a God in Israel,
that thou sendest to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
And he said unto them, What manner of man
was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?
And they answered him,
He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It
is Elijah the Tishbite.
Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.
And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I
be
 a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.
And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I
be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.
And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.
And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron,
is it not because
there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did,
are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?


### 2 Kings Chapter 2

And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said
unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.
And the sons of the prophets that
were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know
it; hold ye your peace.
And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said,
As the LORD liveth, and
as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.
And the sons of the prophets that
were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know
it; hold ye your peace.
And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said,
As the LORD liveth, and
as
 thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.
And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.
And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped
it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing:
nevertheless,
 if thou see me
when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.
And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold,
there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
And Elisha saw
it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;
And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where
is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.
And when the sons of the prophets which
were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.
And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?
And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city
is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water
is naught, and the ground barren.
And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they bring
it to him.
And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren
land.
So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.
And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.
And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.
And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.


### 2 Kings Chapter 3

Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.
Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.
And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I
am as thou
art, my people as thy people,
and my horses as thy horses.
And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.
So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.
And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!
But Jehoshaphat said,
Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, Here
is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.
And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
And Elisha said,
As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.
But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.
And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.
For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.
And this is
but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.
And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.
And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side
as red as blood:
And they said, This
is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in
their country.
And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about
it, and smote it.
And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through
even
 unto the king of Edom: but they could not.
Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him
for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to
their own land.


### 2 Kings Chapter 4

Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.
And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.
Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours,
even empty vessels; borrow not a few.
And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought
the vessels to her; and she poured out.
And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her,
There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.
And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where
was
 a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was,
that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this
is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.
Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.
And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what
is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.
And he said, What then
is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.
And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.
And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord,
thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.
And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.
And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.
And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and
then died.
And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut
the door upon him, and went out.
And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.
And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day?
it is
 neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said,
It shall be
 well.
Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not
thy riding for me, except I bid thee.
So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold,
yonder is that Shunammite:
Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her,
Is it
 well with thee?
is it well with thy husband?
is it
 well with the child? And she answered,
It is well.
And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul
is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid
it from me, and hath not told me.
Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?
Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.
And the mother of the child said,
As the LORD liveth, and
as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.
And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but
there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead,
and laid upon his bed.
He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD.
And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.
Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.
Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.
And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and
there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets
were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.
And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred
them
 into the pot of pottage: for they knew
them not.
So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O
thou man of God,
there is death in the pot. And they could not eat
thereof.
But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast
it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.
And there came a man from Baal-shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.
And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave
thereof.
So he set
it before them, and they did eat, and left
thereof, according to the word of the LORD.


### 2 Kings Chapter 5

Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour,
but he was a leper.
And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman’s wife.
And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord
were with the prophet that
is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.
And
one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that
is of the land of Israel.
And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand
pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have
therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.
And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said,
Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.
And it was
so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.
But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.
Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.
And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father,
if the prophet had bid thee
do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done
it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?
Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that
there is
 no God in all earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.
But he said,
As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take
it; but he refused.
And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules’ burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.
In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant,
that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.
And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.
But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but,
as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.
So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw
him
 running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said,
Is all well?
And he said, All
is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.
And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid
them upon two of his servants; and they bare
them
 before him.
And when he came to the tower, he took
them from their hand, and bestowed
them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.
But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence
comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.
And he said unto him, Went not mine heart
with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee?
Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?
The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper
as white
 as snow.

### 2 Kings Chapter 6

And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.
Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.
And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.
So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.
But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.
And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast
it in thither; and the iron did swim.
Therefore said he, Take
it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.
Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place
shall be my camp.
And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.
And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.
Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us
is for the king of Israel?
And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that
is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.
And he said, Go and spy where he
is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold,
he is in Dothan.
Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.
And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?
And he answered, Fear not: for they that
be with us
are more than they that
be with them.
And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain
was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
And Elisha said unto them, This
is not the way, neither
is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.
And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these
men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold,
they were in the midst of Samaria.
And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite
them? shall I smite
them?
And he answered, Thou shalt not smite
them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.
And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass’s head was
sold for fourscore
pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove’s dung for five
pieces
 of silver.
And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?
And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.
So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.
And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold,
he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.
Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.
But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and
the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door:
is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?
And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil
is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?


### 2 Kings Chapter 7

Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time
shall a measure of fine flour
be sold
 for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold,
if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see
it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.
And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine
is
 in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold,
there was no man there.
For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses,
even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it
was, and fled for their life.
And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid
it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence
also, and went and hid
it.
Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day
is
 a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king’s household.
So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold,
there was
 no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they
were.
And he called the porters; and they told
it to the king’s house within.
And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we
be
 hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.
And one of his servants answered and said, Let
some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they
are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold,
I say, they
are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.
They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way
was
 full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was
sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.
And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:
And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold,
if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.
And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.


### 2 Kings Chapter 8

Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.
And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.
And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.
And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this
is the woman, and this
is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.
And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that
was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.
And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.
And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.
And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.
And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.
And Hazael said, But what,
is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou
shalt be king over Syria.
So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me
that
thou shouldest surely recover.
And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped
it in water, and spread
it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.
And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat
being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.
Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light,
and to his children.
In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.
Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did,
are
 they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.
Two and twenty years old
was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
was
 Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as
did the house of Ahab: for he
was the son in law of the house of Ahab.
And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

## 2 Chronicles

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** 2 Chronicles continues from 1 Chronicles, covering Solomon's reign (c. 970-930 BCE) through Judah's Babylonian exile (586 BCE), paralleling 1 Kings 1-11 and all of 2 Kings but focusing exclusively on Judah's Davidic dynasty. Composed in the post-exilic period (c. 450-400 BCE) alongside 1 Chronicles, the book spans approximately 400 years of monarchic history. The narrative emphasizes Solomon's temple construction and glory, then traces Judean kings' reigns evaluating each by temple faithfulness and covenant obedience. Key periods include: Solomon's prosperous reign and temple dedication (chs. 1-9), the kingdom's division after Rehoboam's folly (ch. 10), alternating faithfulness and apostasy under successive kings, reforming kings like Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah (who receive extensive positive coverage), wicked kings like Ahaz and Manasseh, and final collapse under Babylon ending with Cyrus's decree permitting return (36:22-23). The Chronicler uses sources including Kings, plus additional temple-focused material, writing for post-exilic Jews rebuilding temple and community.

**Author and Audience:** Written by the anonymous Chronicler (same author/circle as 1 Chronicles), demonstrating priestly/Levitical concerns and intimate temple knowledge. Ancient tradition attributes authorship to Ezra, though scholarly consensus favors anonymous authorship. The Chronicler addresses post-exilic Jews in Yehud (Persian-period Judah) who had returned from exile, rebuilt the Second Temple (520-515 BCE), but lacked monarchy and struggled with identity. The book answers: How should we understand our past? What caused exile? What brings divine blessing? By emphasizing temple centrality, immediate retribution (faithfulness brings blessing, sin brings judgment), and hope through covenant obedience, the Chronicler provides theological framework for post-exilic restoration. The ending—Cyrus's decree—offers hope: exile isn't final; God can restore his people.

**Key Themes:** **Temple centrality**: Solomon's temple construction and dedication (chs. 2-7) receives extensive coverage, with temple worship constituting Israel's purpose. **Immediate retribution**: Unlike Kings' complex theology, Chronicles shows direct correlation—obedience brings military victory, prosperity, peace; disobedience brings defeat, illness, death. **Seeking God**: The phrase "seek the LORD/God" appears repeatedly; those who seek prosper, those who forsake suffer. **Reform and apostasy cycles**: Reforming kings (Asa, Jehoshaphat, Joash, Hezekiah, Josiah) restore proper worship; wicked kings lead people astray. **Prayer and divine response**: Extensive prayers by Solomon (ch. 6), Jehoshaphat (20:6-12), Hezekiah (30:18-20) show God responds to humble petition. **"All Israel" unity**: Despite northern kingdom's absence, Chronicles emphasizes "all Israel" should worship at Jerusalem. **Davidic covenant hope**: Focus on Judah's Davidic line (ignoring northern kings entirely) maintains hope in covenant promises despite exile.

**Archaeological Relevance:** 2 Chronicles shares 1-2 Kings' archaeological framework (Assyrian records, Babylonian Chronicles, Lachish reliefs, Siloam Tunnel, Hezekiah's seals, Tel Dan Stele, destruction layers), while adding details debated for historicity. Chronicles' expanded accounts of building projects (Solomon's temple, fortified cities, Asa's fortifications, Jehoshaphat's forts, Hezekiah's preparations) find partial archaeological support in Iron Age II fortification systems and administrative structures. The Chronicler's numbers (army sizes, wealth, spoils) often exceed Kings and may be schematic or rhetorical. Archaeological evidence confirms the general historical framework—Davidic dynasty, temple existence, Assyrian and Babylonian threats, exile—while specific details require careful evaluation. Post-exilic setting explains theological emphases and additional material not in Kings.

**Structure:** 36 chapters: **Part I: Solomon's Glory (1-9):** Temple construction, dedication, divine approval, international fame, wealth—ideal king embodying covenant blessings. **Part II: Divided Kingdom—Judah Only (10-36):** Rehoboam's folly dividing kingdom, then exclusive focus on Judah's Davidic kings: reformers receive extensive positive coverage (Asa ch. 14-16, Jehoshaphat 17-20, Joash 24, Hezekiah 29-32, Josiah 34-35); wicked kings receive brief, negative accounts (Ahaz 28, Manasseh 33); pattern demonstrates retribution theology. Ends with Jerusalem's destruction, exile, and Cyrus's decree (36:15-23) offering hope for restoration.

### 2 Chronicles Chapter 6

Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.
And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.
And he said, Blessed
be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled
that which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying,
Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:
But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart:
Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
And in it have I put the ark, wherein
is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.
And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:
For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven,
And said, O LORD God of Israel,
there is no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and
shewest
 mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:
Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled
it
 with thine hand, as
it is this day.
Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.
Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.
But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!
Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:
That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place.
Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place,
even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.
If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;
Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.
And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;
Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee;
yet if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them;
Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.
If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness
there be:
Then what prayer
or what supplication soever shall be made of any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:
Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)
That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name’s sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house;
Then hear thou from the heavens,
even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as
doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;
Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
If they sin against thee, (for
there is no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before
their
 enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;
Yet
if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;
If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and
toward
 the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:
Then hear thou from the heavens,
even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee.
Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and
let
 thine ears
be attent unto the prayer
that is made
 in this place.
Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.
O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant.


### 2 Chronicles Chapter 7

Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.
And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD’S house.
And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD,
saying, For
he is good; for his mercy
endureth
 for ever.
Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy
endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.
Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that
was
 before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.
Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.
And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.
Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king’s house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.
And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.
If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer
that is made in this place.
For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.
And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;
Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man
to be ruler in Israel.
But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it
to be a proverb and a byword among all nations.
And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?
And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.


### 2 Chronicles Chapter 8

And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,
That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.
And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.
Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.
          As for all the people
that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which
were not of Israel,
But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.
But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they
were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.
And these
were the chief of king Solomon’s officers,
even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.
And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because
the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come.
Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,
Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year,
even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.
And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.
And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.
Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.
And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought
them to king Solomon.


### 2 Chronicles Chapter 9

And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.
And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
And she said to the king,
It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:
Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen
it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me:
for thou exceedest the fame that I heard.
Happy
are thy men, and happy
are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne,
to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.
And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.
And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.
And the king made
of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king’s palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside
that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.
Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;
Beside
that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred
shekels of beaten gold went to one target.
And three hundred shields
made he of beaten gold: three hundred
shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
And
there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,
which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays:
And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon
were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon
were of pure gold: none
were of silver; it was
not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.
And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that
are in the low plains in abundance.
And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands.
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last,
are
 they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.


### 2 Chronicles Chapter 10

And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king.
And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
was
 in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard
it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying,
Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.
And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye
me to return answer to this people?
And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.
But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?
And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou
it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little
finger shall be thicker than my father’s loins.
For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I
will chastise you
 with scorpions.
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I
will chastise you with scorpions.
So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
And when all Israel
saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and
we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel:
and now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.
But
as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that
was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to
his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

### 2 Chronicles Chapter 11

And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen
men,
 which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.
He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
And Beth-zur, and Shoco, and Adullam,
And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which
are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.
And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.
And in every several city
he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
And the priests and the Levites that
were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.
For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest’s office unto the LORD:
And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.
So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.
And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife,
and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;
Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)
And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for
he thought to make him king.
And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.


### 2 Chronicles Chapter 12

And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.
And it came to pass,
that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,
With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people
were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
And he took the fenced cities which
pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and
to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD
is righteous.
And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves;
therefore
 I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed
them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king’s house.
And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.
And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him that he would not destroy
him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.
So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam
was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother’s name
was Naamah an Ammonitess.
And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.
Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last,
are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And
there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.


### 2 Chronicles Chapter 13

Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also
was
 Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war,
even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men,
being
 mighty men of valour.
And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which
is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;
Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever,
even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.
And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.
And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye
be a great multitude, and
there are
 with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.
Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of
other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams,
the same may be a priest of
them that are no gods.
But as for us, the LORD
is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD,
are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites
wait upon
their business:
And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also
set they in order
 upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.
And, behold, God himself is with us for
our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.
But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment
was behind them.
And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle
was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.
And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.
And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.
Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.
But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings,
are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.

### 2 Chronicles Chapter 36

Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem.
Jehoahaz
was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
Jehoiakim
was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did
that which was
 evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they
are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
Jehoiachin
was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did
that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.
And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.
Zedekiah
was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
And he did
that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God,
and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet
speaking
 from the mouth of the LORD.
And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.
Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:
But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till
there was no remedy.
Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave
them all into his hand.
And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all
these he brought to Babylon.
And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.
And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:
To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths:
for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.
Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD
spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and
put it also in writing, saying,
Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which
is in Judah. Who
is there among you of all his people? The LORD his God
be with him, and let him go up.

## Isaiah

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Isaiah is the longest prophetic book, spanning multiple historical periods and potentially multiple authors. The superscription (1:1) dates Isaiah son of Amoz's ministry to four Judean kings: Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (c. 740-686 BCE), during Judah's late monarchic period facing Assyrian expansion. Chapters 1-39 (Proto-Isaiah) address 8th century BCE contexts—Syro-Ephraimite War (735 BCE, chs. 7-8), Assyrian invasions (701 BCE siege of Jerusalem, chs. 36-39)—and contain oracles against Judah, surrounding nations, and apocalyptic material. Chapters 40-55 (Deutero-Isaiah) presuppose Babylonian exile (586-539 BCE), mentioning Cyrus of Persia by name (44:28; 45:1) and addressing exiles' despair with comfort and restoration promises. Chapters 56-66 (Trito-Isaiah) reflect post-exilic realities—returned community, rebuilt temple, and ongoing struggles. Critical scholarship proposes multiple authorship: Isaiah of Jerusalem (8th century BCE) for chs. 1-39, an anonymous "Second Isaiah" in Babylonian exile (6th century BCE) for chs. 40-55, and "Third Isaiah" in post-exilic Judah (late 6th-5th century BCE) for chs. 56-66. Conservative scholarship attributes the entire book to 8th century Isaiah, explaining differences through prophetic foresight and varied audiences. The book's composition extended over 200+ years, reaching final form during the post-exilic period (5th century BCE).

**Author and Audience:** Traditional view attributes all 66 chapters to Isaiah son of Amoz, an 8th century BCE prophet in Jerusalem who advised kings Ahaz and Hezekiah. Isaiah 6 describes his temple vision and calling (c. 740 BCE). Ancient Jewish (Babylonian Talmud) and Christian tradition accepted unified authorship. However, since the medieval period (Ibn Ezra) and especially modern scholarship, most critical scholars identify at least two or three authors: **Proto-Isaiah** (chs. 1-39): 8th century prophet addressing Assyrian threat, Jerusalem's corruption, and Davidic monarchy. **Deutero-Isaiah** (chs. 40-55): Anonymous exilic prophet addressing Babylonian exiles with comfort, monotheistic theology, Servant Songs, and imminent restoration through Cyrus. **Trito-Isaiah** (chs. 56-66): Post-exilic prophet(s) addressing restored community's challenges. Evidence for multiple authorship includes: linguistic differences (vocabulary, style), historical settings (8th century Assyria vs. 6th century Babylon vs. post-exilic Jerusalem), theological development (from judgment to comfort to eschatological hope), and explicit naming of Cyrus (539 BCE) impossible if written 150 years earlier. The book's audiences varied: 8th century Judeans facing Assyrian threat, 6th century Babylonian exiles needing hope, and post-exilic community seeking identity and restoration.

**Key Themes:** Isaiah develops profound theological themes foundational to Judaism and Christianity. **The Holy One of Israel**: Isaiah's favorite divine title (appearing 25 times, rare elsewhere) emphasizes God's transcendent holiness (6:3, "Holy, holy, holy") demanding moral purity from his people. **Judgment and salvation**: The book alternates between severe judgment oracles (chs. 1-5, 13-23) and salvation promises (chs. 9, 11, 40-55), demonstrating covenant consequences while affirming restoration hope. **Messianic prophecies**: Passages interpreted messianically include: Immanuel (7:14), Wonderful Counselor (9:6-7), Jesse's shoot (11:1-10), and especially the Suffering Servant (42:1-9; 49:1-6; 50:4-9; 52:13-53:12)—profoundly influencing Christian interpretation of Jesus. **Remnant theology**: Despite widespread judgment, a faithful remnant survives to inherit promises (1:9; 4:2-6; 10:20-22; 37:31-32). **Monotheism**: Deutero-Isaiah articulates explicit monotheism uniquely in the Old Testament: "I am the LORD, and there is no other" (45:5-6, 18, 22), critiquing idol worship's absurdity (44:9-20). **Divine sovereignty**: God controls history, raises empires (Assyria, Babylon, Persia) as instruments of judgment or deliverance, and announces the future before it happens. **Comfort and restoration**: "Comfort, comfort my people" (40:1) begins the book's second half, promising exile's end, return home, and new exodus. **Universal salvation**: God's salvation extends beyond Israel to nations (42:6; 49:6; 52:10), establishing universal scope. **New creation**: Eschatological vision of new heavens and new earth (65:17; 66:22) transcends historical restoration to cosmic renewal.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Isaiah's 8th century BCE setting receives extensive archaeological corroboration. **Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah**: These Judean kings are confirmed through seals, inscriptions, and synchronisms with Assyrian records. An **Uzziah burial plaque** was discovered stating "Here were brought the bones of Uzziah, king of Judah. Do not open." **Assyrian expansion**: Isaiah's primary threat is well-documented. **Tiglath-Pileser III's annals** confirm campaigns against Syria-Palestine (740s-730s BCE). **Sargon II's inscriptions** mention conquering Ashdod (Isaiah 20 references this). **Sennacherib's Prism** describes the 701 BCE siege of Jerusalem matching Isaiah 36-37, though Sennacherib omits his army's mysterious withdrawal mentioned biblically. The **Siloam Tunnel inscription** describes Hezekiah's water tunnel construction (Isaiah 22:9-11; 2 Kings 20:20), confirming preparations for Assyrian siege. **Great Isaiah Scroll** (1QIsaa) from Qumran (c. 125 BCE) is the oldest complete biblical book, confirming the Masoretic Text's substantial accuracy while showing minor variants. The scroll demonstrates Isaiah was revered and studied intensively in Second Temple Judaism. **Babylonian and Persian periods**: Archaeological evidence for the exile (Babylonian Chronicles, destruction layers in Judah) and Persian return (Cyrus Cylinder) provides historical context for Deutero-Isaiah's message. The prophetic texts themselves become primary sources for understanding these periods' theological interpretation.

**Structure:** 66 chapters divide into three major sections: **Part I: Proto-Isaiah—Judgment and Hope (1-39):** Indictment of Judah and Jerusalem (chs. 1-12): opening accusations, vineyard song, woe oracles, Immanuel prophecies, messianic promises; Oracles against nations (chs. 13-23): Babylon, Assyria, Philistia, Moab, Damascus, Egypt, Tyre; Isaiah's Apocalypse (chs. 24-27): cosmic judgment and eschatological banquet; Woes and promises (chs. 28-35): judgment on Israel and Judah, future restoration; Historical appendix (chs. 36-39): Sennacherib's invasion, Hezekiah's illness, Babylonian envoys. **Part II: Deutero-Isaiah—Comfort and Restoration (40-55):** Comfort for exiles (chs. 40-48): God's sovereignty, idol critique, Cyrus as deliverer, new exodus; Servant Songs and salvation (chs. 49-55): Suffering Servant, Zion restored, universal invitation. **Part III: Trito-Isaiah—New Community (56-66):** Ethics and worship (chs. 56-59): justice, fasting, confession; Zion's glory (chs. 60-62): restoration, vindication; Divine warrior and new creation (chs. 63-66): judgment, final salvation, new heavens and earth. This structure moves from judgment through comfort to eschatological fulfillment.

### Isaiah Chapter 1

The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz,
and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib:
but
 Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.
Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
From the sole of the foot even unto the head
there is no soundness in it;
but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
Your country
is desolate, your cities
are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and
it is
 desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom,
and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
To what purpose
is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.
When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with;
it is
 iniquity, even the solemn meeting.
Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear
them.
And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;
Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken
it.How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.
Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:
Thy princes
are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.
Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:
And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:
And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.
And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners
shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.
For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.
And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench
them.

### Isaiah Chapter 2

The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
And it shall come to pass in the last days,
that the mountain of the LORD’S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.
And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.
Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and
are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.
Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither
is there any
 end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither
is there any end of their chariots:
Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:
And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.
Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.
The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
For the day of the LORD of hosts
shall be upon every
one that is proud and lofty, and upon every
one that is
 lifted up; and he shall be brought low:
And upon all the cedars of Lebanon,
that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,
And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills
that are
 lifted up,
And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,
And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.
And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.
And the idols he shall utterly abolish.
And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made
each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
Cease ye from man, whose breath
is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?


### Isaiah Chapter 3

For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,
The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,
The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.
And I will give children
to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.
And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.
When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father,
saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and
let
 this ruin
be under thy hand:
In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house
is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.
For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings
are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.
The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide
it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.
Say ye to the righteous, that
it shall be well
with him:
 for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
Woe unto the wicked!
it shall be ill
with him:
 for the reward of his hands shall be given him.
          As for my people, children
are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause
thee
 to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.
The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.
The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor
is in your houses.
What mean ye
that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the LORD GOD of hosts.
Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing
as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:
Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.
In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of
their
 tinkling ornaments
about their feet, and
their
 cauls, and
their round tires like the moon,
The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,
The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,
The rings, and nose jewels,
The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,
The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.
And it shall come to pass,
that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth;
and
 burning instead of beauty.
Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.
And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she
being desolate shall sit upon the ground.


### Isaiah Chapter 4

And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.
In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth
shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.
And it shall come to pass,
that he that is left in Zion, and
he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy,
even
 every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:
When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.
And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory
shall be a defence.
And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.


### Isaiah Chapter 5

Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:
And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?
And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up;
and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:
And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts
is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.
Woe unto them that join house to house,
that lay field to field, till
there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!
In mine ears
said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate,
even great and fair, without inhabitant.
Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.
Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning,
that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night,
till wine inflame them!
And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.
Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because
they have
 no knowledge: and their honourable men
are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.
Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.
And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:
But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.
Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:
That say, Let him make speed,
and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know
it!Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
Woe unto
them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!
Woe unto
them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:
Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff,
so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases
were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand
is
 stretched out still.
And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:
None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
Whose arrows
are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses’ hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:
Their roaring
shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry
it away safe, and none shall deliver
it.
And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if
one look unto the land, behold darkness
and
 sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.

### Isaiah Chapter 6

In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.
Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.
And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy,
is
 the LORD of hosts: the whole earth
is full of his glory.
And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
Then said I, Woe
is me! for I am undone; because I
am
 a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.
Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand,
which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
And he laid
it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here
am I; send me.
And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.
Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,
And the LORD have removed men far away, and
there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.
But yet in it
shall be a tenth, and
it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast
their leaves: so the holy seed
shall be
 the substance thereof.


### Isaiah Chapter 7

And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah,
that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field;
And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,
Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it,
even the son of Tabeal:
Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
For the head of Syria
is Damascus, and the head of Damascus
is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.
And the head of Ephraim
is Samaria, and the head of Samaria
is Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,
Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.
But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.
And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David;
Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?
Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.
For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.
The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah;
even the king of Assyria.
And it shall come to pass in that day,
that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that
is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that
is in the land of Assyria.
And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.
In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired,
namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.
And it shall come to pass in that day,
that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;
And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk
that
 they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.
And it shall come to pass in that day,
that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall
even be for briers and thorns.
With arrows and with bows shall
men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.
And
on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.

### Isaiah Chapter 30

Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:
That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!
Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt
your confusion.
For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.
They were all ashamed of a people
that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.
The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence
come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people
that
 shall not profit
them.
For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength
is to sit still.
Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:
That this
is a rebellious people, lying children, children
that will not hear the law of the LORD:
Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:
Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:
Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.
And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters’ vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water
withal out of the pit.
For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.
But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
One thousand
shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.
And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD
is a God of judgment: blessed
are all they that wait for him.
For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.
And
though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:
And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This
is
 the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.
Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.
Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.
The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.
And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers
and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.
Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning
with
 his anger, and the burden
thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:
And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and
there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing
them to err.
Ye shall have a song, as in the night
when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.
And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of
his anger, and
with the flame of a devouring fire,
with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.
For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down,
which smote with a rod.
And
in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him,
it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.
For Tophet
is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made
it deep
and large: the pile thereof
is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.

### Isaiah Chapter 31

Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because
they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!
Yet he also
is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.
Now the Egyptians
are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.
For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him,
he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.
As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver
it; and passing over he will preserve
it.Turn ye unto
him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.
For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you
for a sin.
Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.
And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire
is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.


### Isaiah Chapter 32

Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.
And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.
And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.
The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said
to be bountiful.
For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
The instruments also of the churl
are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.
But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.
Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech.
Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.
Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird
sackcloth upon
your
 loins.
They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns
and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy
in the joyous city:
Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.
Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.
And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.
And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;
When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.
Blessed
are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth
thither the feet of the ox and the ass.


### Isaiah Chapter 33

Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou
wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled;
and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.
O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.
At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.
And your spoil shall be gathered
like the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.
The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.
And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times,
and
 strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD
is his treasure.
Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.
The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.
The earth mourneth
and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed
and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off
their fruits.
Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.
Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath,
as fire, shall devour you.
And the people shall be as the burnings of lime:
as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.
Hear, ye
that are far off, what I have done; and, ye
that are near, acknowledge my might.
The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?
He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;
He shall dwell on high: his place of defence
shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters
shall be
 sure.
Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.
Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where
is the scribe? where
is the receiver? where
is he that counted the towers?
Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue,
that thou canst not understand.
Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle
that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.
But there the glorious LORD
will be unto us a place of broad rivers
and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.
For the LORD
is our judge, the LORD
is our lawgiver, the LORD
is our king; he will save us.
Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.
And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein
shall be forgiven
their iniquity.


### Isaiah Chapter 34

Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it.
For the indignation of the LORD
is upon all nations, and
his fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.
Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling
fig from the fig tree.
For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.
The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness,
and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.
And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
For
it is the day of the LORD’S vengeance,
and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.
And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.
They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none
shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.
And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons,
and
 a court for owls.
The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.
There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.
Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.
And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.


### Isaiah Chapter 35

The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.
It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD,
and the excellency of our God.
Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
Say to them
that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come
with vengeance,
even God
with a recompence; he will come and save you.
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
Then shall the lame
man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.
And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay,
shall be
 grass with reeds and rushes.
And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it
shall be
 for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err
therein.
No lion shall be there, nor
any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk
there:
And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

### Isaiah Chapter 36

Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah,
that
 Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them.
And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field.
Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph’s son, the recorder.
And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?
I say,
sayest thou, (but
they are but vain words)
I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so
is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.
But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God:
is it
 not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?
Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand
it:
 and speak not to us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people that
are on the wall.
But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words?
hath he not
sent me to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?
Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.
Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make
an agreement with me
by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;
Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
Where
are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where
are
 the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
Who
are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that
was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with
their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.


### Isaiah Chapter 37

And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard
it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
And he sent Eliakim, who
was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day
is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and
there is not strength to bring forth.
It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up
thy prayer for the remnant that is left.
So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard
it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed,
as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which
were in Telassar?
Where
is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,
O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest
between the cherubims, thou
art the God,
even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.
Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.
Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,
And have cast their gods into the fire: for they
were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou
art the LORD,
even
 thou only.
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:
This
is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee,
and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted
thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?
even
 against the Holy One of Israel.
By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof,
and
 the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border,
and the forest of his Carmel.
I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
Hast thou not heard long ago,
how I have done it;
and
 of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities
into ruinous heaps.
Therefore their inhabitants
were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were
as the grass of the field, and
as the green herb,
as the grass on the housetops, and
as corn blasted before it be grown up.
But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
And this
shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat
this
 year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:
For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.
Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.
By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.
For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.
Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they
were all dead corpses.
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.

### Isaiah Chapter 60

Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.
For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.
And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.
Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at
thy side.
Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee.
The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall shew forth the praises of the LORD.
All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.
Who
are these
that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?
Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.
And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.
Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that
men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, and
that their kings
may be brought.
For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea,
those nations shall be utterly wasted.
The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through
thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.
Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD
am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.
For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness.
Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.
The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.
Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.
Thy people also
shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.
A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.

### Isaiah Chapter 61

The Spirit of the Lord GOD
is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to
them that are bound;
To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;
To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.
And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien
shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD:
men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.
For your shame
ye shall have double; and
for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.
For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they
are the seed
which the LORD hath blessed.
I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh
himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth
herself with her jewels.
For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.


### Isaiah Chapter 62

For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp
that burneth.
And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.
Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.
For
as a young man marrieth a virgin,
so shall thy sons marry thee: and
as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride,
so shall thy God rejoice over thee.
I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem,
which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,
And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn
to be meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured:
But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.
Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highways; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.
Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward
is with him, and his work before him.
And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.


### Isaiah Chapter 63

Who
is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this
that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.
Wherefore
art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?
I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people
there was
 none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.
For the day of vengeance
is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.
And I looked, and
there was none to help; and I wondered that
there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.
And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.
I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD,
and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
For he said, Surely they
are my people, children
that
 will not lie: so he was their Saviour.
In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.
But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy,
and he fought against them.
Then he remembered the days of old, Moses,
and his people,
saying, Where
is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where
is he that put his holy Spirit within him?
That led
them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?
That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness,
that they should not stumble?
As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.
Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where
is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?
Doubtless thou
art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD,
art our father, our redeemer; thy name
is from everlasting.
O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways,
and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants’ sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.
The people of thy holiness have possessed
it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.
We are
thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.


### Isaiah Chapter 64

Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,
As
when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries,
that the nations may tremble at thy presence!
When thou didst terrible things
which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.
For since the beginning of the world
men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee,
what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.
Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness,
those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.
But we are all as an unclean
thing, and all our righteousnesses
are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
And
there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.
But now, O LORD, thou
art our father; we
are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all
are the work of thy hand.
Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we
are all thy people.
Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.
Wilt thou refrain thyself for these
things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?


### Isaiah Chapter 65

I am sought of
them that asked not
for me; I am found of
them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation
that was not called by my name.
I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way
that was not good, after their own thoughts;
A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;
Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable
things is in their vessels;
Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou.
These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.
Behold,
it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,
Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.
Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and
one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing
is in it: so will I do for my servants’ sakes, that I may not destroy them all.
And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.
And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
But ye
are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.
Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose
that wherein I delighted not.
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:
Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.
And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:
That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
But be ye glad and rejoice for ever
in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner
being an hundred years old shall be accursed.
And they shall build houses, and inhabit
them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree
are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.
They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they
are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.
And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust
shall be the serpent’s meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.

### Isaiah Chapter 66

Thus saith the LORD, The heaven
is my throne, and the earth
is my footstool: where
is the house that ye build unto me? and where
is the place of my rest?
For all those
things hath mine hand made, and all those
things have been, saith the LORD: but to this
man will I look,
even to
him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.
He that killeth an ox
is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb,
as if he cut off a dog’s neck; he that offereth an oblation,
as if he offered swine’s blood; he that burneth incense,
as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.
I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose
that in which I delighted not.
Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name’s sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.
Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.
Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day?
or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut
the womb? saith thy God.
Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:
That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon
her sides, and be dandled upon
her knees.
As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
And when ye see
this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and
his indignation toward his enemies.
For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.
They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one
tree in the midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.
For I
know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations,
to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow,
to Tubal, and Javan,
to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
And they shall bring all your brethren
for an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.
And I will also take of them for priests
and for Levites, saith the LORD.
For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.
And it shall come to pass,
that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.
And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.

## Jeremiah

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Jeremiah prophesied during Judah's final traumatic decades (627-586 BCE) from Josiah's reforms through Jerusalem's destruction. The superscription (1:1-3) dates his ministry from Josiah's 13th year (627 BCE) through Zedekiah's 11th year and Jerusalem's exile (586 BCE)—a 40-year prophetic career spanning five kings: Josiah (640-609 BCE), Jehoahaz (609 BCE, 3 months), Jehoiakim (609-598 BCE), Jehoiachin (598-597 BCE, 3 months), and Zedekiah (597-586 BCE). Key historical events include: Josiah's reforms (622 BCE), his death at Megiddo fighting Pharaoh Necho (609 BCE), Babylonian rise under Nebuchadnezzar (605 BCE Battle of Carchemish), first deportation (597 BCE), Zedekiah's rebellion, and Jerusalem's destruction with second deportation (586 BCE). Jeremiah experienced Egypt's forced exile community after Jerusalem's fall (chs. 42-44). Composition occurred in stages: Jeremiah dictated early oracles to scribe Baruch (ch. 36, 605 BCE), expanded after Jehoiakim burned the scroll, with further additions post-586 BCE. Final compilation occurred during exilic/early post-exilic period (6th century BCE).

**Author and Audience:** Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, a priest from Anathoth (Benjaminite village north of Jerusalem), received his prophetic call as a youth (1:4-10). The book presents extensive biographical material about Jeremiah through third-person narratives (likely written by Baruch, chs. 26-45) alongside first-person oracles, providing intimate portrait of the "weeping prophet's" suffering: persecution, imprisonment, public humiliation, rejection by family, forbidden to marry, thrown in cisterns, and witnessing national catastrophe he predicted. Baruch son of Neriah served as Jeremiah's secretary, writing and preserving oracles (ch. 36, 45). The book's complex composition includes poetry and prose, chronological disorder, and two textual traditions (Hebrew Masoretic Text is 1/8 longer than Greek Septuagint), suggesting extended editorial process. The audience included pre-exilic Judeans whom Jeremiah warned to surrender to Babylon (advice seen as treasonous), exiles in Babylon whom he encouraged to settle and thrive (ch. 29), and post-exilic community seeking to understand catastrophe's theological meaning. Jeremiah's "new covenant" promise (31:31-34) provided hope that exile wasn't final—God would restore and transform his people.

**Key Themes:** **Covenant violation and judgment**: Judah broke covenant through idolatry (especially Baal worship, "high places"), social injustice, and false trust in temple's inviolability ("the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD," 7:4). **Call to repentance**: Despite inevitable judgment, Jeremiah repeatedly called for repentance, using marriage metaphor (chs. 2-3)—Israel as unfaithful wife. **False prophecy**: Jeremiah opposed optimistic prophets proclaiming "Peace, peace" when there was no peace (6:14; 8:11; 28:1-17), predicting Babylonian conquest while others promised deliverance. **Surrender to Babylon**: Controversially, Jeremiah urged submission to Babylon as God's judgment instrument, opposing resistance as futile (21:8-10; 27:1-22). **Personal suffering and lament**: Jeremiah's "confessions" (11:18-23; 12:1-6; 15:10-21; 17:14-18; 18:18-23; 20:7-18) reveal prophetic anguish, cursing his birth and questioning God. **New covenant**: Amid judgment, Jeremiah promised future restoration through new covenant written on hearts, not stone tablets (31:31-34)—foundational for Christianity. **Remnant and restoration**: Exile wasn't final; God would restore Judah after 70 years (25:11-12; 29:10), gather remnant, and establish Davidic king (23:5-6; 33:14-26). **Potter and clay**: God shapes nations like potter shapes clay (18:1-12), demonstrating sovereignty while allowing human response to alter outcomes.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Jeremiah's setting receives extensive archaeological confirmation. **Babylonian Chronicles** document Nebuchadnezzar's campaigns: Battle of Carchemish (605 BCE), first capture of Jerusalem (597 BCE), appointing Zedekiah as puppet king. **Lachish Letters** (ostraca from 588-587 BCE) show final days before Babylonian conquest, mentioning signals from Azekah and Lachish matching Jeremiah 34:7. **Baruch bulla** (seal impression) discovered in Jerusalem reads "Belonging to Berekhyahu son of Neriyahu the scribe" (Baruch son of Neriah), directly confirming Jeremiah's secretary. Multiple bullae mention officials named in Jeremiah: Gemariah son of Shaphan, Jerahmeel son of the king. **Destruction layers** at Jerusalem, Lachish, Azekah, and throughout Judah date to 586 BCE, confirming Babylonian devastation's extent. **Judean pillar figurines** found in destruction layers represent fertility goddess worship Jeremiah condemned. **Elephantine Papyri** mention "Johanan" leading Egyptian Jewish community, matching Jeremiah 43:2-7 about forced migration to Egypt. The **Ketef Hinnom silver scrolls** (7th-6th century BCE) contain priestly blessing from Numbers 6, confirming biblical text's pre-exilic existence and Jeremiah's scriptural context.

**Structure:** 52 chapters with complex organization (chronological disorder, thematic arrangements): **Part I: Prophecies Against Judah (1-25):** Call narrative (ch. 1), early oracles condemning idolatry and covenant violation (chs. 2-6), temple sermon and false trust (chs. 7-10), broken covenant (chs. 11-13), drought and judgment (chs. 14-17), potter analogy and confessions (chs. 18-20), oracles against kings and false prophets (chs. 21-23), 70-year exile prophecy (chs. 24-25). **Part II: Conflict Narratives (26-29):** Temple sermon confrontation (ch. 26), symbolic yoke (chs. 27-28), letter to exiles (ch. 29). **Part III: Book of Consolation (30-33):** Restoration promises, new covenant (31:31-34), land purchase symbolizing hope (ch. 32), Davidic promises (ch. 33). **Part IV: Fall of Jerusalem (34-45):** Various episodes during siege, Zedekiah's rebellion, cistern imprisonment, Jerusalem's fall, Gedaliah's governorship and assassination, forced migration to Egypt, Baruch narrative (ch. 45). **Part V: Oracles Against Nations (46-51):** Egypt, Philistia, Moab, Ammon, Edom, Damascus, Kedar, Elam, Babylon. **Part VI: Historical Appendix (52):** Jerusalem's destruction details (parallel to 2 Kings 24-25), Jehoiachin's release.

### Jeremiah Chapter 1

The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that
were
 in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee,
and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.
Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I
am
 a child.
But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I
am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.
Be not afraid of their faces: for I
am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.
Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.
See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.
Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.
And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof
is
 toward the north.
Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.
For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.
And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.
Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.
For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I
am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.

### Jeremiah Chapter 24

The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs
were
 set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
One basket
had very good figs,
even like the figs
that are first ripe: and the other basket
had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for
their good.
For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull
them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck
them up.
And I will give them an heart to know me, that I
am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.
And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:
And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for
their hurt,
to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.
And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.


### Jeremiah Chapter 25

The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that
was
 the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;
The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that
is the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.
And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending
them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear.
They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever:
And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words,
Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.
Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.
And this whole land shall be a desolation,
and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished,
that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.
And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it,
even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.
For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.
For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.
And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
Then took I the cup at the LORD’S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me:
To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as
it is this day;
Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;
And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,
Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,
And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea,
Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all
that are in the utmost corners,
And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert,
And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,
And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which
are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.
And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.
For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.
Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread
the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
A noise shall come
even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them
that are wicked to the sword, saith the LORD.
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from
one end of the earth even unto the
other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.
Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves
in the ashes,
 ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.
And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.
A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock,
shall be heard: for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture.
And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.

### Jeremiah Chapter 26

In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying,
Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD’S house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD’S house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:
If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.
And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,
To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending
them, but ye have not hearkened;
Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded
him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.
Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king’s house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD’S
house.
Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man
is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.
Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.
Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.
As for me, behold, I
am in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.
But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.
Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man
is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.
Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,
Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed
like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.
Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.
And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:
And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;
And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt,
namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and
certain men with him into Egypt.
And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.


### Jeremiah Chapter 27

In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,
And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;
And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters;
I have made the earth, the man and the beast that
are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.
And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.
And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.
And it shall come to pass,
that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.
Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:
For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.
But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.
For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.
Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD’S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.
Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?
But if they
be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and
in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.
For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city,
Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain
in the house of the LORD, and
in
 the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;
They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.


### Jeremiah Chapter 28

And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year,
and in the fifth month,
that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which
was
 of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD’S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:
And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,
Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD’S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.
Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;
The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass,
then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.
Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it.
And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah
the prophet,
 after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.
So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.


### Jeremiah Chapter 29

Now these
are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;
(After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)
By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;
Build ye houses, and dwell
in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;
Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.
And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that
be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.
For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD.
For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.
For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.
Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.
And ye shall seek me, and find
me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.
Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;
Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city,
and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.
And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:
Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending
them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.
Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;
And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which
are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;
Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours’ wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and
am a witness, saith the LORD.
          Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that
are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man
that is
 mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.
Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?
For therefore he sent unto us
in Babylon, saying, This
captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell
in them;
 and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,
Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.


### Jeremiah Chapter 30

The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.
For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
And these
are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?
Alas! for that day
is great, so that none
is like it: it
is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.
For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts,
that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:
But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.
Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make
him afraid.
For I
am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.
For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise
is incurable,
and
 thy wound
is grievous.
There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.
All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity;
because thy sins were increased.
Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow
is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity:
because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.
Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast,
saying, This
is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.
Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.
And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.
And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who
is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.
And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.
The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done
it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.

### Jeremiah Chapter 31

At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
Thus saith the LORD, The people
which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness;
even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.
The LORD hath appeared of old unto me,
saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.
Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat
them as common things.
For there shall be a day,
that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God.
For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.
Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth,
and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.
They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim
is
 my firstborn.
Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare
it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd
doth his flock.
For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of
him that was stronger than he.
Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.
Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation,
and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they
were not.
Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border.
I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself
thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed
to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou
art the LORD my God.
Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon
my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
Is Ephraim my dear son?
is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD.
Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the highway,
even the way
which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.
How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice,
and mountain of holiness.
And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they
that go forth with flocks.
For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.
Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.
And it shall come to pass,
that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD.
In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.
But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day
that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:
But this
shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day,
and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts
is his name:
If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD,
then
 the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.
Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.
And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.
And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east,
shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.

## Micah

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Micah prophesied during the reigns of Jotham (750-735 BCE), Ahaz (735-715 BCE), and Hezekiah (715-686 BCE) of Judah (1:1), placing his ministry approximately 735-700 BCE, contemporary with Isaiah in Jerusalem and the later phases of Hosea's northern ministry. Micah witnessed tumultuous events: the Syro-Ephraimite War (735-732 BCE) when Syria and Israel attacked Judah to force anti-Assyrian coalition membership (2 Kings 16, Isaiah 7); Samaria's fall to Assyria (722 BCE) ending the Northern Kingdom; and Sennacherib's devastating 701 BCE invasion of Judah that destroyed 46 fortified cities (including Lachish) and besieged Jerusalem (2 Kings 18-19). Micah 1:10-16 likely refers to Sennacherib's campaign, listing destroyed Shephelah towns. Jeremiah 26:17-19 quotes Micah 3:12 ("Zion shall be plowed as a field"), noting that Hezekiah responded to Micah's prophecy with repentance rather than execution, implicitly crediting Micah's preaching for Hezekiah's religious reforms (2 Kings 18:4, 2 Chronicles 29-31). Unlike his contemporary Isaiah who had access to the royal court, Micah represented rural Judah's perspective, speaking for exploited farmers and villagers against Jerusalem's elite who "build Zion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquity" (3:10). Critical scholars distinguish authentic 8th century material (chs 1-3, parts of 6-7) from later additions (4-5, restoration oracles), though conservative scholars defend substantial unity with minor later expansions.

**Author and Audience:** Micah was from Moresheth-gath (1:1, 14), a town in Judah's Shephelah (lowland) region about 25 miles southwest of Jerusalem, near the Philistine border and strategically positioned along trade routes. His hometown's proximity to Philistine territory and vulnerability to invasion (destroyed in 701 BCE) shaped his message. Unlike Isaiah's aristocratic Jerusalem perspective, Micah spoke for rural villagers victimized by Jerusalem's landowning elite who "covet fields and seize them, houses, and take them away; they oppress a man and his house, a man and his inheritance" (2:2), violating ancestral land tenure principles (Leviticus 25, Naboth's vineyard in 1 Kings 21). Micah addressed both Israel (Northern Kingdom, before 722 BCE, 1:5-7) and especially Judah, targeting Jerusalem's leadership: political rulers who "hate the good and love the evil" (3:2), judges who "give judgment for a bribe," priests who "teach for a price," and prophets who "divine for money" (3:11). His audience included the wealthy elite he condemned and the peasant class he championed. The book's preservation and editing occurred in Jerusalem, with possible exilic/post-exilic additions expanding hope oracles (4:1-5:15). Micah's influence extended into the New Testament: Matthew 2:6 quotes Micah 5:2 (Bethlehem as Messiah's birthplace), and Jesus's mission echoes Micah 6:8 ("do justice, love mercy, walk humbly with God").

**Key Themes:** **Social Justice**: Micah fiercely condemns economic exploitation: wealthy landowners evicting peasants from ancestral land (2:1-2, 8-9), corrupt judges accepting bribes (3:11, 7:3), merchants using false weights (6:10-11), and powerful elites conspiring to defraud the vulnerable (7:2-3). His famous summary of true religion – "do justice, love kindness, and walk humbly with your God" (6:8) – prioritizes ethical orthopraxy over ritual. **Judgment on Leadership**: Micah targets ruling classes: political leaders "who tear the skin from off my people" with cannibalistic imagery (3:1-3), false prophets who "lead my people astray" promising peace for payment (3:5-7), and priests who teach for hire (3:11). Jerusalem itself faces destruction: "Zion shall be plowed as a field" (3:12), a prophecy remembered a century later (Jeremiah 26:18). **Remnant Theology**: Despite judgment, God preserves a faithful "remnant of Jacob" (2:12, 5:7-8), a theme developed by Isaiah and later prophets. The remnant will be purified and restored. **Messianic Hope**: Micah 5:2-5 prophesies a ruler from Bethlehem Ephrathah (David's hometown) who will "shepherd his flock" and bring peace, interpreted messianically in Jewish and Christian tradition (quoted in Matthew 2:6, John 7:42). **Universal Peace**: The famous vision of nations streaming to Zion to learn Torah, beating "swords into plowshares" (4:1-4, paralleled in Isaiah 2:2-4), envisions international peace under God's universal reign. **Covenant Lawsuit (Rîb)**: Chapter 6:1-8 presents a covenant lawsuit where God summons Israel to trial, recounting saving acts (Exodus, Balaam) and asking what sacrifice God requires, answered by ethical demands rather than ritual (6:8).

**Archaeological Relevance:** Micah's 8th-7th century BCE context receives extensive archaeological confirmation. **Moresheth-gath**: Identified with **Tell ej-Judeideh**, excavations reveal Iron Age II settlement destroyed in Sennacherib's 701 BCE campaign, matching Micah's lament over Shephelah towns (1:10-16). **Lachish**: Micah 1:13 mentions Lachish as "the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion"; **Lachish reliefs** in Sennacherib's palace at Nineveh dramatically depict the 701 BCE siege and capture, while **Lachish Letters** (c. 587 BCE, later period) reference prophets negatively, reflecting tensions Micah experienced. **Sennacherib's Annals** (Taylor Prism, British Museum) describe the 701 BCE campaign: "I besieged and captured 46 strong cities... I shut up Hezekiah the Judean in Jerusalem like a bird in a cage," corroborating 2 Kings 18:13-19:36 and contextualizing Micah 1:10-16. **Hezekiah's Reforms**: Archaeological evidence includes **centralization of worship** (destruction of provincial altars like Beersheba and Arad), **LMLK jar seals** ("Belonging to the King") showing administrative reorganization, and **Siloam Tunnel inscription** describing water system construction (2 Kings 20:20, 2 Chronicles 32:30) – reforms possibly influenced by Micah's preaching (Jeremiah 26:18-19 explicitly links Micah's prophecy to Hezekiah's repentance). **Land Tenure Practices**: Iron Age II ostraca and legal texts evidence ancestral land inheritance systems Micah defends (2:2), including **Samaria Ostraca** showing estate management and **Arad ostraca** documenting land transfers. **Social Stratification**: Urban excavations (Jerusalem, Lachish) reveal wealthy elite residences versus deteriorating lower-class quarters, archaeological evidence of inequality Micah condemns.

**Structure:** Micah's 7 chapters alternate between judgment and hope oracles in three cycles. **Chapters 1-2: First Cycle** opens with theophany (God descending to judge, 1:2-4) followed by judgment on Samaria and Judah (1:5-16), specifically condemning land seizure (2:1-5) and false prophets (2:6-11), concluding with remnant hope (2:12-13). Micah 1:10-16 contains a series of wordplays on Shephelah town names lamenting their destruction. **Chapters 3-5: Second Cycle** presents Micah's harshest judgment oracles against leaders (3:1-12) – cannibalistic imagery for rulers (3:1-4), condemnation of false prophets (3:5-8), and prediction of Jerusalem's destruction (3:9-12, quoted in Jeremiah 26:18) – followed by hope oracles: nations streaming to Zion (4:1-5, paralleled in Isaiah 2:2-4), future restoration (4:6-13), and Bethlehem messianic prophecy (5:2-5). **Chapters 6-7: Third Cycle** features the covenant lawsuit (6:1-8) with its famous summary "do justice, love kindness, walk humbly" (6:8), judgment on corrupt economic practices (6:9-16), lament over social decay where families cannot be trusted (7:1-7), and concluding with confidence in divine forgiveness and restoration (7:8-20), ending with liturgical affirmation "Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity?" (7:18, playing on "Micah" = "Who is like Yahweh?"). Scholars debate the structure's redactional history, with many viewing chapters 4-5 as later additions, though the judgment-hope alternation may reflect authentic prophetic tension holding both realities simultaneously.

### Micah Chapter 2

Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.
And they covet fields, and take
them by violence; and houses, and take
them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time
is evil.
In that day shall
one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation,
and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed
it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.
Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.
Prophesy ye not,
say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them,
that they shall not take shame.
O
thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened?
are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?
Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.
The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.
Arise ye, and depart; for this
is not
your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy
you, even with a sore destruction.
If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie,
saying,
 I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.
I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of
the multitude of men.
The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.


### Micah Chapter 3

And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel;
Is it not for you to know judgment?
Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.
Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.
Therefore night
shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.
Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for
there is no answer of God.
But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.
They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say,
Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.
Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed
as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.


### Micah Chapter 4

But in the last days it shall come to pass,
that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.
And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make
them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken
it.
For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.
In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;
And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.
And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.
Now why dost thou cry out aloud?
is there no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.
Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go
even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.
But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.
Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.


### Micah Chapter 5

Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah,
though thou be little among the thousands of Judah,
yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me
that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth
have been
 from of old, from everlasting.
Therefore will he give them up, until the time
that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.
And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.
And this
man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.
And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver
us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.
And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.
And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.
Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:
And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:
And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no
more soothsayers:
Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.
And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.
And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.

### Micah Chapter 6

Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.
Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD’S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.
O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.
For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.
Wherewith shall I come before the LORD,
and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?
Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams,
or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn
for my transgression, the fruit of my body
for the sin of my soul?
He hath shewed thee, O man, what
is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?
The LORD’S voice crieth unto the city, and
the man of wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.
Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure
that is abominable?
Shall I count
them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?
For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue
is deceitful in their mouth.
Therefore also will I make
thee sick in smiting thee, in making
thee desolate because of thy sins.
Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down
shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and
that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.
Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.
For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.


### Micah Chapter 7

Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage:
there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.
The good
man is perished out of the earth: and
there is
 none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.
That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge
asketh for a reward; and the great
man, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.
The best of them
is as a brier: the most upright
is sharper than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen
and thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.
Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.
For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man’s enemies
are the men of his own house.
Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.
Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD
shall be a light unto me.
I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light,
and I shall behold his righteousness.
Then
she that is mine enemy shall see
it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.
In the day that thy walls are to be built,
in that day shall the decree be far removed.
In that day
also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and
from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and
from mountain to mountain.
Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.
Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily
in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed
in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous
things.The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay
their hand upon
their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.
They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.
Who
is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth
in mercy.
He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob,
and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.

## Part 8: Babylonian Exile

### Historical and Cultural Background: Babylonian Exile

**Historical Context (Destruction and Captivity (~586-539 BCE))**

The Babylonian Exile lasted approximately 50 years (586-539 BCE), though technically exile began with earlier deportations (597 BCE took elite including King Jehoiachin; 586 BCE destroyed Jerusalem and temple; 582 BCE saw third deportation after Gedaliah's assassination). Extra-biblical sources extensively document these events: Babylonian Chronicles record Nebuchadnezzar's campaigns against Jerusalem (597 and subsequent years); Babylonian ration lists document provisions for "Jehoiachin, king of Judah" and his sons in captivity; archaeological destruction layers at Jerusalem, Lachish, and throughout Judah date to early 6th century BCE. The exile represented catastrophic rupture in Israelite history: temple destroyed (Yahweh's dwelling place eliminated), Davidic kingship ended (seemingly contradicting eternal dynasty promises), land lost (covenant blessing revoked), and population deported to foreign land. However, exile's impact should be nuanced: archaeological evidence suggests substantial population remained in Judah ("the poorest people of the land"—2 Kings 25:12), though urban centers were destroyed and political infrastructure eliminated. The Mizpah administrative center under Gedaliah briefly governed remaining population until his assassination prompted further flight to Egypt. Exile ended politically when Persian King Cyrus conquered Babylon (539 BCE) and issued edict permitting return (538 BCE), though many Jews remained in Babylon, establishing diaspora pattern. Theologically, exile constituted formative crisis reshaping Judaism: prophetic interpretation as covenant judgment for persistent idolatry, development of Torah-centered piety independent of temple/land, emergence of synagogue worship, and refined monotheistic theology.

**Geographic Setting**

The exilic experience encompassed multiple geographic contexts. In Judah, destruction was concentrated in Judean heartland: Jerusalem razed, temple burned, walls destroyed, major cities like Lachish demolished. Archaeological surveys show dramatic population decline in Judean highlands but relative continuity in northern Benjamin region (Mizpah, Bethel) which became Babylonian administrative center. The Shephelah suffered devastation, while Negev sites abandoned. The exiles themselves were deported to Babylonia, concentrated in southern Mesopotamia near Nippur. Biblical references locate exiles at Tel-abib on the Kebar River (Ezekiel 3:15), probably a canal near Nippur. The Murashu documents (5th century BCE business archive from Nippur) mention numerous Jewish names, confirming substantial Jewish settlement in this region. Babylon itself, the great imperial capital with its hanging gardens, massive walls (excavated and reconstructed), Ishtar Gate, and temple complexes (ziggurats) provided imposing contrast to modest Jerusalem. The exiles encountered sophisticated urban civilization with complex irrigation agriculture in fertile alluvial plains contrasting with Judean hill country. Some exiles fled to Egypt following Gedaliah's assassination (Jeremiah accompanied this group), establishing Jewish community at Elephantine (archaeological evidence includes Aramaic papyri documenting Jewish military colony with Yahweh temple). Thus, the "exile" actually involved multiple populations in multiple locations: deportees in Babylonia, refugees in Egypt, and remnant in Judah—each developing distinct experiences and perspectives.

**Cultural Context**

Exilic cultural experience divided between the displaced elite in Babylon and the remaining poor in Judah. In Babylon, exiles maintained ethnic identity despite immersion in dominant Mesopotamian culture. They settled in distinct communities (Tel-abib, other settlements), apparently maintaining social organization under "elders" who consulted prophets like Ezekiel. Economic integration occurred—Murashu documents show Jews engaging in agriculture, commerce, and business transactions using Babylonian names alongside Hebrew names. Cultural assimilation pressures were significant: Babylonian language (Aramaic increasingly replaced Hebrew as spoken language), Babylonian names (Daniel's companions given Babylonian names), Babylonian dating systems, exposure to Mesopotamian mythology and religion. Yet counter-pressures maintained distinctiveness: prohibition of intermarriage, dietary restrictions, circumcision, Sabbath observance, and Torah study created boundary markers. The absence of temple necessitated new worship forms—prayer, Torah reading, communal gatherings (proto-synagogue development). Scribal activity intensified: editing and compiling biblical traditions (Deuteronomistic History, Priestly material), prophetic writings (Ezekiel, Second Isaiah), and historical reflection. In Judah, the remaining population lived in reduced circumstances. Lamentations poetically expresses trauma: "How deserted lies the city, once so full of people!" Archaeological evidence shows shift from urban centers to small agricultural settlements. Cultural continuity maintained through residual population, but loss of centralized institutions (temple, palace, priesthood) meant decentralized practice. Some syncretism likely occurred among remnant population less supervised by traditional religious authority.

**Political Context**

Politically, the exile meant complete loss of Judean sovereignty and incorporation into Neo-Babylonian imperial administration. The Babylonian Empire (626-539 BCE) under Nebuchadnezzar II (605-562 BCE) dominated the ancient Near East after defeating Assyria and Egypt. Judah fell as part of broader imperial consolidation. After 586 BCE, Judah became Babylonian province, governed initially from Mizpah under Gedaliah (Judean appointee, not Davidic descendant—2 Kings 25:22-26). Gedaliah's assassination by Ishmael (Davidic descendant acting from nationalistic motives) ended this brief autonomous administration and prompted Babylonian reprisals and third deportation (582 BCE). Subsequently, the province likely administered directly from Samaria or integrated into broader Trans-Euphrates administrative unit. The exiles in Babylon existed as subject population without political autonomy, though community organization under elders provided internal governance. Nebuchadnezzar's successors (Evil-merodach who released Jehoiachin from prison—2 Kings 25:27-30; Nabonidus) maintained control until Persian conquest. The Persian takeover (539 BCE) under Cyrus fundamentally changed imperial policy: whereas Babylonians practiced deportation and cultural suppression, Persians pursued religious tolerance and local autonomy, issuing the Cyrus Cylinder's policy statement allowing return of deported peoples and restoration of local cults. This policy shift enabled Jewish return and temple reconstruction, though under Persian oversight. The Davidic dynasty, however, never regained kingship—Zerubbabel (Davidic descendant, Persian-appointed governor) faced prophetic hope for restoration (Haggai, Zechariah), but monarchy never resumed. Henceforth, Jewish political identity would function through religious rather than national-political structures.

**Economic Context**

The economic situation varied dramatically by location and status. In devastated Judah, the economy reverted to subsistence level after destruction of urban centers, loss of administrative infrastructure, and deportation of skilled artisans and merchants. The land was redistributed to "the poorest people of the land" (2 Kings 25:12) who became vineyard workers and farmers, presumably on estates formerly owned by deported elite. Archaeological evidence shows pottery production declined in quality and quantity, specialization disappeared, and settlement pattern shifted from fortified towns to small villages. Trade collapsed with loss of administrative organization. However, agricultural production continued—Judah remained agriculturally viable, and the remnant population cultivated lands. In Babylon, exiles initially faced displacement hardship but apparently integrated economically over time. Jeremiah's letter advised, "Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce" (29:5), suggesting agricultural settlement. The Murashu documents demonstrate by 5th century (one generation later) Jews functioned successfully in Babylonian economy: owning/leasing land, engaging in commerce, participating in banking operations, using Babylonian business practices. Some Jews achieved significant economic success—this economic integration would make return unattractive for many exiles, establishing permanent diaspora. For temple/palace elite who formed substantial portion of deportees, exile meant status loss and economic displacement. The tribute economy that had supported temple and palace operations ceased, eliminating economic base for priestly and royal classes, though some compensation occurred through Persian imperial policy later supporting temple restoration with royal subsidy.

**Religious Context**

The exile precipitated Judaism's most profound theological crisis and transformation. Temple destruction eliminated the central cult site where Yahweh dwelled and sacrifice occurred, raising fundamental questions: Had Yahweh been defeated by Babylonian gods? Had covenant failed? Were promises to David and Israel revoked? Prophetic interpretation provided theological framework: exile resulted from covenant unfaithfulness (idolatry, social injustice) as prophets had warned—Yahweh judged his own people, validating rather than contradicting divine sovereignty. Ezekiel's vision of divine glory leaving temple (ch 10-11) interpreted destruction as Yahweh's deliberate judgment, not divine impotence. Conversely, Second Isaiah proclaimed that exile would end through Yahweh's sovereign action using Cyrus as agent, asserting Yahweh's universal control. Without temple, worship adapted: prayer replaced sacrifice, Torah study intensified, communal gatherings for reading/prayer (proto-synagogues) developed. Priestly circles compiled and edited traditions, producing much of the Pentateuch's final form (Priestly material), while Deuteronomistic editors completed their historical work explaining exile as covenant judgment. Theological innovations emerged: universalistic monotheism (Yahweh as sole God controlling all nations, not merely national deity), individualized responsibility (Ezekiel's emphasis on individual rather than corporate guilt), and hope for new covenant written on hearts (Jeremiah 31). Sabbath observance, circumcision, and dietary laws became identity markers maintaining distinctiveness in diaspora. The exile permanently transformed Judaism from temple-centered cult tied to land into Torah-centered religion portable to diaspora. Messianic hope developed, longing for restored Davidic kingdom, though increasingly spiritualized when political restoration proved impossible. Post-exilic Judaism inherited this theological synthesis: monotheistic, Torah-centered, synagogue-based, maintaining temple cult when possible but no longer dependent on it, emphasizing covenant faithfulness as path to divine favor, and anticipating eschatological restoration.

## Lamentations

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Lamentations responds directly to Jerusalem's destruction by Babylon (586 BCE), composed shortly after the catastrophe while ruins smoldered and trauma remained raw. The five poems mourn the city's devastation, temple's burning, starvation during siege, mass death, and exile—describing horrors matching archaeological destruction layers. Ancient tradition (Septuagint, Targums, Babylonian Talmud) dates composition to immediate aftermath (586-580 BCE), and internal evidence supports eyewitness perspective. The book became liturgically associated with Tisha B'Av (9th of Av), annual fast commemorating temple destructions (both 586 BCE and 70 CE).

**Author and Audience:** Ancient tradition attributes Lamentations to Jeremiah the prophet, based on 2 Chronicles 35:25 mentioning Jeremiah's laments for Josiah and thematic connections to Jeremiah's book. The Septuagint explicitly names Jeremiah as author. However, modern scholarship questions this attribution due to: differences in Hebrew style/vocabulary from Jeremiah, acrostic structure unlike Jeremiah's prophecies, and theological perspectives suggesting different author(s). The poems likely stem from Jerusalem survivors—priests, scribes, or prophetic circles—who witnessed catastrophe firsthand. The audience included fellow survivors in Jerusalem's ruins and early Babylonian exiles processing unbearable trauma through liturgical lament, seeking to make sense of national annihilation while maintaining faith in God despite apparent divine abandonment.

**Key Themes:** **Communal lament and grief**: The five poems express raw anguish, describing Jerusalem as bereaved widow (1:1), calling readers to witness suffering's magnitude. **Divine judgment**: God orchestrated destruction as covenant punishment for sin—"The LORD has done what he purposed" (2:17). **Theodicy and innocent suffering**: While acknowledging sin, poems protest disproportionate suffering, especially of children and elderly. **Hope amid despair**: Central chapter (3) pivots from lament to hope: "Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed... great is your faithfulness" (3:22-23), providing theological anchor despite devastation. **Call for divine intervention**: Repeated pleas for God to "Look... see" (1:9, 11, 20; 2:20; 5:1) and act to restore and judge enemies.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Destruction layers throughout Judah date to 586 BCE, confirming devastation Lamentations describes. Lachish Letters and ostraca from final days before conquest match the book's desperate siege atmosphere. Babylonian Chronicles document Jerusalem's capture. The book itself is primary source for understanding the exile's psychological and theological trauma.

**Structure:** 5 chapters, first 4 are acrostic poems (each verse/section begins with successive Hebrew alphabet letters), chapter 5 has 22 verses (matching alphabet) but not acrostic: Ch. 1: Jerusalem personified as widow; Ch. 2: God as destroyer; Ch. 3: Individual lament transitioning to hope (longest, 3-line acrostic); Ch. 4: Contrasting past glory with present horror; Ch. 5: Communal plea for restoration. The acrostic form imposes order on chaos, containing overwhelming grief within literary structure.

### Lamentations Chapter 1

How doth the city sit solitary,
that was full of people
how is she become as a widow she
that was great among the nations,
and princess among the provinces,
how is she become tributary
She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears
are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort
her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.
Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.
The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she
is in bitterness.
Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.
And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts
that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her,
and did mock at her sabbaths.
Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.
Her filthiness
is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified
himself.
The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen
that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command
that they should not enter into thy congregation.
All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile.
          Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted
me in the day of his fierce anger.
From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate
and faint all the day.
The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed,
and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into
their hands,
from whom I am not able to rise up.
The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty
men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah,
as in a winepress.
For these
things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.
Zion spreadeth forth her hands,
and there is none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob,
that his adversaries
should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.
The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.
I called for my lovers,
but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.
Behold, O LORD; for I
am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home
there is as death.
They have heard that I sigh:
there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done
it: thou wilt bring the day
that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.
Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs
are many, and my heart
is faint.


### Lamentations Chapter 2

How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger,
and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!
The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought
them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.
He hath cut off in
his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire,
which devoureth round about.
He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all
that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.
The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as
if it were of
 a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.
The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.
Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes
are among the Gentiles: the law
is no
more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.
The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground,
and
 keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
They say to their mothers, Where
is corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers’ bosom.
What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?
Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.
All that pass by clap
their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem,
saying, Is this the city that
men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed
her up: certainly this
is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen
it.
The LORD hath done
that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused
thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.
Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.
Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.
Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit,
and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?
The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain
them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed,
and not pitied.
Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD’S anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.

## Ezekiel

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Ezekiel prophesied among Babylonian exiles from 593-571 BCE during Judah's final years and aftermath. The book provides precise chronological markers: Ezekiel's call occurred in the 5th year of King Jehoiachin's exile (593 BCE, 1:2), with dated oracles through the 27th year (571 BCE, 29:17). Ezekiel was deported in 597 BCE with 10,000 elite Judeans including King Jehoiachin (2 Kings 24:10-17), settling at Tel-abib by Kebar Canal near Nippur in southern Babylon. His prophetic ministry spanned Jerusalem's final decade, the city's destruction (586 BCE), and early exile years. The book's composition exhibits remarkable literary unity—structured chronology, consistent theology, recurring patterns—suggesting single author or careful editorial preservation of Ezekiel's authentic material, composed during or shortly after events described (6th century BCE).

**Author and Audience:** Ezekiel son of Buzi, a Zadokite priest (1:3), experienced prophetic call through spectacular vision of divine chariot-throne by Kebar Canal (ch. 1). He prophesied from his house in exile (3:24; 8:1) with elders visiting for consultation (8:1; 14:1; 20:1). The book's extensive priestly concerns—temple visions, purity laws, sacrificial details, divine glory—reflect his priestly training. Ezekiel performed bizarre symbolic actions (lying on side 390/40 days, cooking food on dung, shaving head, packing exile baggage, 4:1-5:4; 12:1-16; 24:15-27) and experienced dramatic visions (divine chariot, valley of dry bones, restored temple). Ancient Jewish tradition identified Ezekiel's authenticity; later rabbinic Judaism debated the book's heterodoxy (especially chs. 40-48 contradicting Torah). The audience comprised Babylonian exiles struggling to maintain identity and faith without temple, land, or monarchy, whom Ezekiel addressed through oracles explaining Jerusalem's destruction (divine judgment), condemning false hope of early return, and ultimately promising restoration and new covenant.

**Key Themes:** **Divine glory and sovereignty**: The book begins and ends with visions of divine glory (1:1-28; 43:1-5), demonstrating Yahweh transcends temple and geography—the same glory dwelt in exile. **Theological explanation of exile**: God abandoned temple due to abominations (ch. 8), with glory departing (10:18-19; 11:22-25) before Babylonian destruction—Yahweh, not Babylon, destroyed Jerusalem. **Individual responsibility**: Against popular fatalism ("fathers eat sour grapes, children's teeth set on edge," 18:2), Ezekiel emphasized individual accountability—each person dies for their own sin (ch. 18, 33). **Prophetic watchman**: Ezekiel as appointed watchman must warn people; their response determines guilt (3:16-21; 33:1-9). **Symbolic actions and visions**: Bizarre street theater communicated messages nonverbally to exile community. **Restoration promises**: After judgment sections, restoration oracles promise: new heart/spirit (36:26-27), valley of dry bones resurrection (ch. 37), reunified kingdom, renewed David, new temple with divine glory returning (40-48). **Oracles against nations**: Nations oppressing Israel will face judgment (chs. 25-32), especially Tyre and Egypt.

**Archaeological Relevance:** **Tel-abib and Kebar Canal**: Archaeological surveys identify Tel-abib near Nippur; the Kebar (likely Kabaru canal) appears in cuneiform texts as irrigation canal in Nippur region. **Babylonian exile context**: Thousands of cuneiform tablets document Babylonian life, including ration lists mentioning "Yaukin king of Judah" (Jehoiachin) and his sons, confirming exilic community's existence. **Murashu archive** texts (5th century BCE) show Jewish business activity in Nippur region. **597 and 586 BCE deportations**: Babylonian Chronicles confirm both Jerusalem captures and deportations Ezekiel references. **Temple vision details**: Ezekiel 40-48 describes elaborate temple plan with precise measurements; while Solomon's and Herod's temples differ, the vision reflects authentic ancient Near Eastern temple architecture and priestly knowledge. **Destruction imagery**: Ezekiel's descriptions of Jerusalem's siege, starvation, and burning match archaeological destruction layers.

**Structure:** 48 chapters organized chronologically and thematically: **Part I: Judgment on Jerusalem (1-24):** Call vision and commissioning (chs. 1-3), symbolic actions predicting siege (chs. 4-5), oracles against Jerusalem and Judah (chs. 6-7), temple vision showing abominations and glory's departure (chs. 8-11), continued judgment oracles and symbolic actions (chs. 12-24), culminating with wife's death symbolizing Jerusalem's fall (24:15-27). **Part II: Oracles Against Nations (25-32):** Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistia (ch. 25), Tyre (chs. 26-28), Sidon (ch. 28), Egypt (chs. 29-32). **Part III: Restoration and Hope (33-48):** Renewed watchman commission (ch. 33), oracles against false shepherds/leaders (ch. 34), judgment on Edom (ch. 35), restoration promises including new heart/spirit (ch. 36), valley of dry bones vision (ch. 37), Gog and Magog apocalyptic battle (chs. 38-39), vision of restored temple with returning glory and renewed worship (chs. 40-48). The structure moves from judgment through international judgment to restoration, mirroring exile-return trajectory.

And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth
month,
 the tenth
day of the month,
that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me.
Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,
Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me?
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.
Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge
them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:
And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I
am the LORD your God;
In the day
that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which
is the glory of all lands:
Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I
am the LORD your God.
But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they
were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.
And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which
if a man do, he shall even live in them.
Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I
am the LORD that sanctify them.
But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which
if
 a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.
Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given
them, flowing with milk and honey, which
is the glory of all lands;
Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.
Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.
But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:
I
am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;
And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I
am the LORD your God.
Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which
if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.
I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;
Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.
Wherefore I gave them also statutes
that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;
And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through
the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I
am the LORD.
Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.
For when I had brought them into the land,
for
 the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.
Then I said unto them, What
is the high place whereunto ye go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.
Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations?
For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel?
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.
And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.
          As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:
And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.
And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.
Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.
And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:
And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I
am the LORD.
As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter
also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.
For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.
And ye shall know that I
am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country
for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.
And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.
And ye shall know that I
am the LORD, when I have wrought with you for my name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop
thy word
 toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;
And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.
And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.
Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables?

### Ezekiel Chapter 21

And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop
thy word
 toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,
And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I
am
 against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.
Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.
Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of
thy
 loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.
And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak
as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:
It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son,
as every tree.
And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it
shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon
thy thigh.
Because
it is a trial, and what if
the sword contemn even the rod? it shall be no
more, saith the Lord GOD.
Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite
thine hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it
is the sword of the great
men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.
I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that
their heart may faint, and
their ruins be multiplied: ah!
it is made bright,
it is wrapped up for the slaughter.
Go thee one way or other,
either on the right hand,
or on the left, whithersoever thy face
is set.
I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said
it.
The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,
Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose
it at the head of the way to the city.
Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.
For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made
his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.
At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint
battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount,
and to build a fort.
And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because,
I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.
And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity
shall have an end,
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this
shall not
be the same: exalt
him that is low, and abase
him that is high.
I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no
more,
 until he come whose right it is; and I will give it
him.
And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword
is drawn: for the slaughter
it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering:
Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of
them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity
shall have an end.
Shall I cause
it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.
And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men,
and skilful to destroy.
Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no
more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken
it.

### Ezekiel Chapter 22

Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.
Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.
Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come
even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.
Those that be near, and
those that be far from thee, shall mock thee,
which art infamous
and much vexed.
Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.
In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.
Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.
In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.
In thee have they discovered their fathers’ nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.
And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.
In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.
Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.
Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken
it, and will do
it.
And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.
And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I
am the LORD.
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they
are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are
even the dross of silver.
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt
it;
 so will I gather
you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave
you there, and melt you.
Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.
As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Son of man, say unto her, Thou
art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.
Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed
difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
Her princes in the midst thereof
are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood,
and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.
And her prophets have daubed them with untempered
morter,
 seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.
The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.


### Ezekiel Chapter 23

The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,
Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.
And the names of them
were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus
were
 their names; Samaria
is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.
And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians
her neighbours,
Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them
that were
 the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.
Neither left she her whoredoms
brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.
Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.
These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.
And when her sister Aholibah saw
this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in
her whoredoms.
She doted upon the Assyrians
her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
Then I saw that she was defiled,
that they
took
 both one way,
And
that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,
Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:
And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.
And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.
So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.
Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh
is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue
is like the issue of horses.
Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.
Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;
The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa,
and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.
And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people,
which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.
And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.
They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.
Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom
brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand
of them whom thou hatest, into the hand
of them from whom thy mind is alienated:
And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
I will do these
things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen,
and because thou art polluted with their idols.
Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.
Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.
Thou shalt even drink it and suck
it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken
it, saith the Lord GOD.
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;
That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through
the fire, to devour
them.
Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.
For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.
And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger
was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,
And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.
And a voice of a multitude being at ease
was with her: and with the men of the common sort
were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.
Then said I unto
her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she
with them?
Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.
And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they
are adulteresses, and blood
is in their hands.
For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.
And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.
Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I
am the Lord GOD.


### Ezekiel Chapter 24

Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth
day
 of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Son of man, write thee the name of the day,
even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.
And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set
it on, and also pour water into it:
Gather the pieces thereof into it,
even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill
it with the choice bones.
Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it,
and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.
Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum
is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall up on it.
For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;
That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.
Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.
Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and
that the filthiness of it may be molten in it,
that the scum of it may be consumed.
She hath wearied
herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum
shall be in the fire.
In thy filthiness
is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.
I the LORD have spoken
it: it shall come to pass, and I will do
it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.
Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.
Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not
thy
 lips, and eat not the bread of men.
So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these
things are to us, that thou doest
so?
Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.
And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover
your lips, nor eat the bread of men.
And your tires
shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.
Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I
am the Lord GOD.
Also, thou son of man,
shall it not
be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,
That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause
thee to hear
it with
thine ears?
In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I
am the LORD.


### Ezekiel Chapter 25

The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,
Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;
And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;
Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.
And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I
am the LORD.
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped
thine
 hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel;
Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I
am the LORD.
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah
is like unto all the heathen;
Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities
which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,
Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.
And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I
am the LORD.
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.
And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy
it
 for the old hatred;
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I
am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.

### Ezekiel Chapter 26

And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first
day
 of the month,
that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken
that was the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall be replenished,
now she is laid waste:
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I
am against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up.
And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.
It shall be
a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken
it, saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations.
And her daughters which
are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I
am the LORD.
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.
He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee.
And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.
By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.
With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.
And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.
And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.
And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be
a place
 to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken
it, saith the Lord GOD.
Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?
Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at
every moment, and be astonished at thee.
And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed,
that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror
to be on all that haunt it!
Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that
are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.
For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee;
When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;
I will make thee a terror, and thou
shalt be no
more:
 though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD.


### Ezekiel Chapter 27

The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,
Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;
And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea,
which art a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I
am of perfect beauty.
Thy borders
are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.
They have made all thy
ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.
Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches
of ivory,
brought
 out of the isles of Chittim.
Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.
The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise
men, O Tyrus,
that were in thee, were thy pilots.
The ancients of Gebal and the wise
men thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.
They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.
The men of Arvad with thine army
were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.
Tarshish
was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all
kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.
Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they
were thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.
They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.
The men of Dedan
were thy merchants; many isles
were
 the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee
for a present horns of ivory and ebony.
Syria
was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.
Judah, and the land of Israel, they
were thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.
Damascus
was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.
Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.
Dedan
was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.
Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these
were they thy merchants.
The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they
were thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.
Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur,
and
 Chilmad,
were thy merchants.
These
were thy merchants in all sorts
of things,
 in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.
The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.
Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.
Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that
are in thee, and in all thy company which
is
 in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.
The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.
And all that handle the oar, the mariners,
and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;
And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:
And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart
and
 bitter wailing.
And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee,
saying, What
city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?
When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.
In the time
when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.
All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in
their countenance.
The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou
shalt be
 a terror, and never shalt be any more.

## Daniel

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Daniel presents the most contested dating in the Old Testament. The book's narrative is set during the Babylonian exile (605-539 BCE) and early Persian period, following Daniel and companions deported to Babylon serving under Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, Darius the Mede, and Cyrus. Traditional dating accepts 6th century BCE composition by Daniel himself. However, most critical scholars date composition to the Maccabean crisis (167-164 BCE) based on: extensive Hellenistic period Greek loanwords, detailed prophecies about Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-164 BCE) becoming vague afterward, linguistic features (Late Biblical Hebrew, Imperial Aramaic), historical inaccuracies about Babylonian/Persian periods (Belshazzar as Nebuchadnezzar's son, "Darius the Mede"), canonical placement (in Writings, not Prophets in Hebrew Bible), and absence from Ben Sira's list of heroes (180 BCE). Critical scholarship views Daniel as apocalyptic literature addressing Maccabean persecution through coded historical references (vaticinia ex eventu—prophecy after the fact). Conservative scholars defend 6th century dating, explaining difficulties as scribal updates, different historical traditions, or gaps in our knowledge. The book reached final form around 165 BCE.

**Author and Audience:** The book claims authorship by Daniel, a Judean noble deported to Babylon in 605 BCE, serving in Babylonian and Persian courts with supernatural wisdom interpreting dreams/visions. However, critical scholarship views "Daniel" as pseudonymous—an ancient sage figure (mentioned in Ezekiel 14:14, 20; 28:3 alongside Noah and Job) invoked by 2nd century BCE author to provide authority for apocalyptic visions addressing Maccabean crisis. The bilingual nature (Hebrew chs. 1, 8-12; Aramaic chs. 2-7) and genre shift (court tales chs. 1-6; apocalyptic visions chs. 7-12) suggest composite work. The audience was Jews suffering under Antiochus IV Epiphanes' persecution (167-164 BCE)—temple desecrated, Torah banned, forced Hellenization, martyrdoms—whom the book encouraged to remain faithful through coded assurance that God controls history, empires rise and fall on divine schedule, and faithful martyrs will be vindicated through resurrection. The visions culminate precisely at Antiochus's persecution, providing hope for imminent divine intervention (which came through Maccabean victory and temple rededication, 164 BCE—Hanukkah).

**Key Themes:** **Divine sovereignty over history**: God controls kingdoms, raises and deposes rulers (2:21; 4:17, 25), and has predetermined history's course. **Faithfulness under persecution**: Daniel and companions maintain Torah fidelity despite pressure (dietary laws ch. 1, refusing idolatry chs. 3, 6), modeling resistance for Maccabean audience. **Wisdom and revelation**: Human wisdom fails; only God reveals mysteries (2:27-28), giving understanding to his servants. **Four kingdoms schema**: Visions present four successive empires (traditionally Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome; or Babylon, Media, Persia, Greece) culminating in God's eternal kingdom (chs. 2, 7). **Apocalyptic eschatology**: Unlike prophets emphasizing repentance and restoration within history, Daniel presents cosmic conflict, angelic battles (ch. 10), resurrection (12:2—first clear Old Testament resurrection reference), final judgment, and transcendent divine kingdom breaking into history. **Martyrdom and vindication**: Those killed for faithfulness will be resurrected to eternal life (12:2-3), providing theological justification for martyrdom. **"Son of Man"**: One "like a son of man" receives eternal dominion (7:13-14)—later interpreted messianically.

**Archaeological Relevance:** **Dead Sea Scrolls**: Eight Daniel manuscripts at Qumran (including 4QDana-d) show Daniel was widely copied/studied by 2nd-1st centuries BCE, confirming Maccabean-era popularity. **Antiochus IV persecution**: 1-2 Maccabees, Josephus, and archaeological evidence (coins, inscriptions) confirm Antiochus's persecution, temple desecration with Zeus altar (the "abomination of desolation," Dan 11:31), matching Daniel's detailed descriptions. **Historical issues**: Belshazzar (ch. 5) was Nabonidus's son, never sole king; no "Darius the Mede" is known (possibly confused with Darius I of Persia or Cyrus); Nebuchadnezzar's madness (ch. 4) resembles Nabonidus's absence traditions. These suggest author writing centuries later with imperfect historical knowledge. **Greek loanwords**: Persian and Greek terms for musical instruments (3:5) indicate Hellenistic-period composition. The book reflects authentic ancient Near Eastern court settings and apocalyptic genre conventions.

**Structure:** 12 chapters in two parts: **Part I: Court Tales (1-6, primarily Aramaic):** Daniel and friends in Babylonian court maintain dietary purity (ch. 1); Nebuchadnezzar's dream of statue—four kingdoms (ch. 2); fiery furnace—friends refuse idolatry (ch. 3); Nebuchadnezzar's madness—divine sovereignty (ch. 4); Belshazzar's feast—handwriting on wall, fall to Persians (ch. 5); Daniel in lions' den—Persian decree against prayer (ch. 6). These tales model faithful resistance under foreign rule. **Part II: Apocalyptic Visions (7-12, primarily Hebrew):** Vision of four beasts and Son of Man (ch. 7, paralleling ch. 2); vision of ram and goat—Persian and Greek empires (ch. 8); seventy weeks prophecy (ch. 9, reinterpreting Jeremiah 25:11-12); vision of future history through Antiochus IV (chs. 10-11); resurrection and final judgment (ch. 12). The structure moves from narrative encouragement to apocalyptic revelation, both supporting faithfulness under persecution.

### Daniel Chapter 2

And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.
Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.
And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.
Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.
The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.
They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.
The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.
But if ye will not make known unto me the dream,
there is but
 one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.
The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore
there is
 no king, lord, nor ruler,
that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.
And
it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise
men of Babylon.
And the decree went forth that the wise
men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.
Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise
men of Babylon:
He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why
is
 the decree
so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.
Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:
That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise
men of Babylon.
Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:
And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:
He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what
is
 in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.
I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast
now made known unto us the king’s matter.
Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise
men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise
men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.
Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.
The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name
was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?
Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise
men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;
But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;
As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came
into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.
But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for
any
 wisdom that I have more than any living, but for
their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.
Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof
was
 terrible.
This image’s head
was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,
His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet
that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.
Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
This
is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
Thou, O king,
art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou
art this head of gold.
And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.
And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all
things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.
And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.
And
as the toes of the feet
were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.
And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.
And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people,
but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.
The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth
it is,
 that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldst reveal this secret.
Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise
men of Babylon.
Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel
sat
 in the gate of the king.


### Daniel Chapter 3

Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height
was
 threescore cubits,
and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:
And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down
and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.
They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.
Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:
And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth,
that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
Then Nebuchadnezzar in
his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.
Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them,
Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?
Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made;
well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who
is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we
are not careful to answer thee in this matter.
If it be
so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver
us out of thine hand, O king.
But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego:
therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
And he commanded the most mighty men that
were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,
and to cast
them
 into the burning fiery furnace.
Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their
other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.
And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste,
and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.
He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.
Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace,
and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come
hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the fire.
And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.
Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed
be
 the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.
Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.


### Daniel Chapter 4

Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.
I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.
How great
are his signs! and how mighty
are his wonders! his kingdom
is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion
is from generation to generation.
I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:
I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.
Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise
men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.
Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.
But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name
was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream,
saying,
O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods
is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
Thus
were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof
was
 great.
The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:
The leaves thereof
were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it
was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.
I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;
He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:
Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and
let his portion
be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:
Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.
This matter
is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.
This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise
men
 of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou
art able; for the spirit of the holy gods
is in thee.
Then Daniel, whose name
was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream
be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.
The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;
Whose leaves
were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it
was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:
It
is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and
let his portion
be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;
This
is the interpretation, O king, and this
is
 the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:
That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.
Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquility.
All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.
The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?
While the word
was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven,
saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.
And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling
shall be
 with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.
The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles
feathers, and his nails like birds’
claws.
And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion
is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom
is from generation to generation:
And all the inhabitants of the earth
are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and
among
 the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?
At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.
Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works
are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.


### Daniel Chapter 5

Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.
Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which
was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.
Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which
was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.
They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.
The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers.
And the king spake, and said to the wise
men
 of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and
have
 a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
Then came in all the king’s wise
men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.
Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.
          Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house:
and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:
There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom
is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king,
I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans,
and soothsayers;
Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.
Then was Daniel brought in before the king.
And the king spake and said unto Daniel,
Art thou that Daniel, which
art
 of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?
I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods
is
 in thee, and
that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.
And now the wise
men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:
And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and
have
 a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:
And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.
But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:
And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling
was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and
that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.
And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;
But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath
is, and whose
are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:
Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.
And this
is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
This
is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.
TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.
PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.
Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and
put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.
And Darius the Median took the kingdom,
being about threescore and two years old.

### Daniel Chapter 6

It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;
And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel
was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.
Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit
was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he
was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.
Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find
it against him concerning the law of his God.
Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.
All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.
Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.
Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king’s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask
a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which
is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.
Then the king, when he heard
these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set
his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.
Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians
is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.
Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast
him
 into the den of lions.
Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.
And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.
Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.
Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.
And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel:
and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?
Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.
My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.
Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.
And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast
them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.
Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.
I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom
that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion
shall be even unto the end.
He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.


### Daniel Chapter 7

In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream,
and
 told the sum of the matters.
Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.
And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
The first
was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.
And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and
it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.
After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it
was diverse from all the beasts that
were before it; and it had ten horns.
I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn
were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.
I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment
was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne
was like the fiery flame,
and
 his wheels
as burning fire.
A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld
even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.
As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.
I saw in the night visions, and, behold,
one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.
And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion
is
 an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom
that which shall not be destroyed.
I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of
my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
These great beasts, which are four,
are four kings,
which shall arise out of the earth.
But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth
were of iron, and his nails
of brass;
which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;
And of the ten horns that
were in his head, and
of
 the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even
of
 that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look
was more stout than his fellows.
I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
And the ten horns out of this kingdom
are ten kings
that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.
And he shall speak
great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.
But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy
it unto the end.
And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom
is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
Hitherto
is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.


### Daniel Chapter 8

In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me,
even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.
And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I
was at Shushan
in the palace, which
is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.
Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had
two horns: and the
two horns
were high; but one
was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither
was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat
had
 a notable horn between his eyes.
And he came to the ram that had
two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.
And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.
And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant
land.
And it waxed great,
even to the host of heaven; and it cast down
some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.
Yea, he magnified
himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily
sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.
And an host was given
him against the daily
sacrifice
 by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.
Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain
saint which spake, How long
shall be the vision
concerning the daily
sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
And it came to pass, when I,
even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.
And I heard a man’s voice between
the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this
man to understand the vision.
So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end
shall be the vision.
Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.
And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end
shall be.
The ram which thou sawest having
two horns
are
 the kings of Media and Persia.
And the rough goat
is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that
is between his eyes
is the first king.
Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.
And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.
And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.
And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify
himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told
is
 true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it
shall be
 for many days.
And I Daniel fainted, and was sick
certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood
it.

### Daniel Chapter 9

In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;
In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.
And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:
And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;
We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:
Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
O Lord, righteousness
belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel,
that are near, and
that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.
O Lord, to us
belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
To the Lord our God
belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;
Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.
Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that
is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.
And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.
As
it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.
Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God
is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.
And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people
are become a reproach to all
that are about us.
Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord’s sake.
O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.
O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
And whiles I
was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;
Yea, whiles I
was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.
And he informed
me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.
At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew
thee; for thou
art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.
Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.
Know therefore and understand,
that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince
shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof
shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.
And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make
it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

## Part 9: Persian Period and Return

### Historical and Cultural Background: Persian Period and Return

**Historical Context (Restoration under Persia (~539-330 BCE))**

The Persian Period spanned over two centuries (539-330 BCE) from Cyrus's conquest of Babylon through Alexander the Great's conquest of the Persian Empire. For Judaism, this period proved foundational: Cyrus's edict (538 BCE) permitted return and temple reconstruction; Zerubbabel led early returnees and completed Second Temple (520-516 BCE); Ezra arrived ca. 458 BCE (or possibly 398 BCE—chronology debated) implementing Torah reforms; Nehemiah served as governor (445-433 BCE) rebuilding Jerusalem's walls. Extra-biblical sources confirm the historical framework: the Cyrus Cylinder documents Cyrus's policy of allowing deported peoples to return and restore local cults; Persian administrative documents from Egypt (Elephantine papyri) mention Jerusalem temple, Sanballat (Nehemiah's opponent), and Persian officials; archaeological evidence shows limited Persian-period occupation in Judah (Yehud province). However, scholarly debate surrounds the return's extent: biblical sources suggest mass return, but archaeological evidence indicates modest reoccupation—Jerusalem remained small (perhaps 1,500 inhabitants), many sites unoccupied, population estimates suggest only 10,000-20,000 in entire Yehud province. Many exiles remained in Babylon and Egypt, establishing permanent diaspora communities. The biblical accounts (Ezra-Nehemiah-Chronicles) present theologically shaped history emphasizing temple reconstruction and Torah centrality. Persian imperial administration allowed religious autonomy while maintaining political control through appointed governors (Zerubbabel, Nehemiah, others) and tribute requirements. This period established post-exilic Judaism's fundamental features: temple-centered worship restored, Torah as authoritative scripture, exclusive ethnic identity, priesthood reorganization, and increasing emphasis on purity regulations distinguishing Jews from surrounding peoples.

**Geographic Setting**

The Persian Period Jewish experience centered primarily in three geographic locations: Yehud (Persian province of Judah), Babylon (diaspora community), and Egypt (including Elephantine military colony). Yehud province occupied substantially smaller territory than pre-exilic Judah—essentially the Benjamin region and immediate Jerusalem environs, perhaps 30 km radius from Jerusalem. Archaeological surveys reveal that Shephelah, Negev, and much of former Judean territory remained sparsely populated or under other administrative control (Idumaea in south, Samaria in north). Jerusalem remained modest: city walls enclosed limited area until Nehemiah's expansion, and population stayed small compared to pre-exilic period. The Second Temple, completed 516 BCE, occupied same site as Solomon's temple but dimensions and splendor apparently fell short of the first temple—prompting older returnees who remembered Solomon's temple to weep (Haggai 2:3). Other Yehud settlements included Bethel, Mizpah, Gibeon, and few others, with finds including Yehud stamp impressions on pottery indicating provincial administration. The Babylonian Jewish community flourished in southern Mesopotamia, particularly near Nippur, with Murashu documents revealing economic integration and prosperity that made return unattractive for many. Elephantine in Upper Egypt housed Jewish military colony with temple to Yahweh (archaeological evidence includes Aramaic papyri documenting religious practices, conflicts with Egyptian neighbors, correspondence with Jerusalem authorities). The geographic dispersal created diaspora pattern continuing to present—temple in Jerusalem as symbolic center, but majority of Jews living elsewhere maintaining religious identity through Torah observance, synagogue worship, and connections to Jerusalem.

**Cultural Context**

Post-exilic Jewish culture developed distinctive features balancing restoration of pre-exilic traditions with adaptations necessitated by Persian imperial context and diaspora existence. In Yehud, the returnees (golah community) considered themselves the "true Israel," distinguished from "people of the land" ('am ha'aretz) who had remained during exile. This created social tension—Ezra-Nehemiah emphasize separation from surrounding peoples, prohibiting intermarriage and demanding dissolution of existing mixed marriages, though this exclusivism faced resistance. The community organized around temple and Torah: priests (particularly Zadokite lineage) held religious authority, scribes gained increased importance as Torah interpreters, and lay leaders (governor, community elders) managed civil affairs under Persian oversight. Persian cultural influence appears in: Aramaic replacing Hebrew as spoken language (though Hebrew maintained for scripture and worship), Persian loanwords in biblical texts, Persian administrative titles, and Persian-period material culture (pottery, coinage, architecture). Literacy probably increased with scribal class expansion and Torah's centralization as authoritative text. The Great Assembly (or Great Synagogue) traditions claim canonization activities during this period, standardizing scriptural texts. Ezra's public Torah reading (Nehemiah 8) established pattern of communal scripture study. Festivals—Passover, Tabernacles, Day of Atonement—received renewed emphasis as identity markers. The Elephantine papyri reveal diaspora community practicing distinct Judaism: they maintained Yahweh temple (problematic from Jerusalem perspective emphasizing exclusive centralization), celebrated Passover (correspondence with Jerusalem about proper observance), but also showed syncretistic elements (oaths invoking multiple deities). Cultural boundaries hardened: circumcision, Sabbath observance, dietary laws, and endogamy distinguished Jews from Gentiles. This period produced substantial biblical literature: Chronicles, Ezra-Nehemiah, final editing of prophetic books, compilation of Psalter, possibly Ruth (presenting counter-narrative to Ezra-Nehemiah exclusivism), and Song of Songs.

**Political Context**

Politically, Persian-period Jews lived as subjects of the vast Achaemenid Persian Empire, which at its height controlled territory from India to Egypt, from Central Asia to the Arabian Peninsula. The Persian administrative system organized territory into satrapies (provinces), with Yehud constituting a small province within the larger Trans-Euphrates (Beyond the River) satrapy. Persian kings relevant to biblical history include: Cyrus the Great (559-530 BCE, issued return edict), Cambyses (530-522 BCE), Darius I (522-486 BCE, authorized temple completion), Xerxes I/Ahasuerus (486-465 BCE, Esther's husband in biblical account), Artaxerxes I (465-424 BCE, authorized Ezra and Nehemiah missions), and subsequent rulers through Darius III (336-330 BCE, defeated by Alexander). Persian policy combined religious tolerance with firm political control: subject peoples could practice traditional religion and maintain cultural identity, but political authority remained Persian, tribute was required, and imperial administration was enforced. Yehud's governance functioned through appointed officials: Sheshbazzar (initial returnee leader), Zerubbabel (governor, Davidic descendant—messianic hopes attached but not realized), Nehemiah (cupbearer to Artaxerxes appointed governor), and subsequent governors. The high priest gained increased political importance in absence of monarchy—Jeshua (Joshua) served alongside Zerubbabel, establishing priestly political authority pattern. Conflicts appear in Ezra-Nehemiah: opposition from Samaritan governor Sanballat, Tobiah the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arab (neighboring officials viewing Jerusalem's fortification as potential rebellion). The rebuilt walls provoked investigation but Persian authorities ultimately supported Jerusalem. Jewish political identity shifted from national kingship to religious community under foreign rule—a pattern continuing through Hellenistic and Roman periods. The lack of political independence proved permanent—except for brief Hasmonean period (2nd-1st centuries BCE), Jews would not regain sovereignty until 20th century CE.

**Economic Context**

The economic situation in Persian-period Yehud remained modest. The province's small size, limited population, and modest agricultural resources meant subsistence-level economy. Agriculture continued as foundation: terraced viticulture, olive cultivation, fig production, grain farming in valleys, though productivity remained below pre-exilic levels given reduced population and cultivated area. Archaeological evidence shows simple pottery, limited luxury goods, and absence of monumental architecture beyond temple reconstruction. Persian taxation required tribute payments—Nehemiah 5 describes economic hardship, with poor Jews mortgaging fields and vineyards, borrowing money at interest, even selling children into slavery to meet tax obligations. Nehemiah implemented debt relief and forbade usury, addressing economic inequality exacerbated by imperial taxation. The temple functioned as economic institution: receiving tithes and offerings, managing agricultural lands, and distributing to priests and Levites. Yehud stamp impressions on storage jars indicate provincial administration of agricultural products. Persian royal subsidies supported temple operations—Cyrus returned temple vessels, later Persian kings provided funds and materials for reconstruction and ongoing maintenance. Some economic improvement occurred over time: evidence of Persian-period silver coinage bearing "Yehud" inscription suggests monetary economy development, and trade connections with Mediterranean coast (Phoenician influence) and inland regions. However, Yehud remained economically marginal. By contrast, diaspora communities in Babylon and Egypt often prospered: Murashu documents show Jews engaging successfully in banking, commerce, and agriculture; Elephantine papyri document military colony with regular provisions. This economic disparity meant diaspora life often proved more attractive than return to impoverished Yehud, explaining why majority of exiles remained in diaspora. The economic reality underlying theological tension in prophetic literature: Haggai and Zechariah urged temple reconstruction promising economic blessing, while persistent economic hardship tested faith in restoration promises.

**Religious Context**

Religious practice and theology underwent fundamental transformation during Persian period, establishing patterns definitive for later Judaism. Temple reconstruction (completed 516 BCE) restored sacrificial cult and priestly system, but the Second Temple never achieved First Temple's glory or independence—it functioned under Persian oversight with royal subsidies and limitations. The high priesthood gained unprecedented importance: without monarchy, high priests functioned as community leaders, lineage and purity regulations emphasized, and priestly authority over law and cult centralized. Prophetic figures (Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi) encouraged temple rebuilding but thereafter prophetic activity diminished—Torah and priesthood replaced prophecy as authoritative religious voices. Torah achieved central, authoritative status: Ezra's public reading and interpretation (Nehemiah 8) established scripture's communal centrality, scribes gained importance as Torah interpreters, and canonical consciousness developed. The shift from temple-centered to Torah-centered Judaism, begun in exile, matured during this period—while temple remained important, Judaism could now function without it through Torah study and observance. Synagogue worship developed, though evidence remains limited—the institution emerged from exilic prayer gatherings and provided local worship alternative to distant temple. Purity regulations intensified: intermarriage prohibition, Sabbath observance strictness, dietary law emphasis, and cult purity standards created clear boundaries between Jews and Gentiles. The Elephantine correspondence reveals tension over proper practice: Elephantine Jews maintained their own temple (which Jerusalem authorities viewed as illegitimate), demonstrating diversity in diaspora Judaism. Messianic hope persisted but adapted: prophetic oracles (Haggai-Zechariah) initially hoped for Davidic restoration through Zerubbabel, but when monarchy didn't return, messianic expectations spiritualized or postponed to future eschatological fulfillment. Wisdom literature flourished (Proverbs compiled, Job and Ecclesiastes possibly composed), exploring theodicy questions raised by exile/restoration experience. The Persian period established Second Temple Judaism's fundamental character: temple worship when possible, Torah-centered piety, priestly authority, ethnic boundary maintenance, diaspora existence accepted as normative, and awaiting eschatological fulfillment of restoration promises.

## Ezra

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Ezra chronicles the Jewish return from Babylonian exile under Persian authorization, covering two main periods: the first return under Zerubbabel (538 BCE) and temple reconstruction (520-515 BCE), then Ezra's mission approximately 80 years later (458 or 398 BCE, dating debated). The book opens with Cyrus the Great's decree (539 BCE) permitting exiled peoples to return home—confirmed by the Cyrus Cylinder. The narrative follows: first return led by Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel with 42,360 people (ch. 1-2), foundation laying amid opposition (ch. 3-4), temple completion under prophets Haggai and Zechariah during Darius I's reign (ch. 5-6, 520-515 BCE), then a chronological gap before Ezra's arrival with Torah and reforming mission (ch. 7-10). Composition date is disputed: traditional view attributes authorship to Ezra himself (5th century BCE), while critical scholarship proposes later composition (4th century BCE or later) by the same Chronicler who wrote Chronicles, though this theory is now contested. The book was composed for the post-exilic Jewish community establishing identity, governance, and religious practice under Persian rule in the province of Yehud.

**Author and Audience:** Authorship is attributed to Ezra "the scribe," a priest and Torah expert sent by Persian King Artaxerxes with authority to establish Jewish law (7:12-26). However, the book contains third-person narrative about Ezra alongside first-person memoirs (the "Ezra Memoir," 7:27-9:15), suggesting compilation by Ezra or a later editor. Ancient tradition (2 Esdras, Babylonian Talmud) credits Ezra as author and links the book with Nehemiah and Chronicles. The book incorporates official Persian documents (in Aramaic, 4:8-6:18; 7:12-26), lists, and genealogies, indicating use of archival sources. The intended audience was the struggling post-exilic community in Judah facing questions of identity, legitimacy, intermarriage with surrounding peoples, Torah observance, and relationship to Persian authorities. The book addresses: Who are the true people of God? How should we relate to non-Jews? What is the foundation of community life? Ezra's answers emphasize genealogical purity, Torah centrality, separation from foreign peoples, proper worship, and divine providence working through Persian decree.

**Key Themes:** **Divine sovereignty and providence**: God moves the hearts of Persian kings (Cyrus, Darius, Artaxerxes) to authorize and fund temple rebuilding and Jewish restoration, demonstrating that exile doesn't negate divine control. **Temple centrality**: Rebuilding the Jerusalem temple (chs. 3-6) constitutes primary goal, establishing worship as community foundation. **Torah authority**: Ezra brings "the Book of the Law of Moses" (7:6) and teaches it publicly, establishing Scripture as constitutional foundation for post-exilic Judaism. **Genealogical legitimacy**: Extensive lists (ch. 2, 8) establish who rightfully belongs to restored community; inability to prove Israelite descent results in exclusion (2:59-63), including priests unable to verify Aaronic lineage. **Separation from foreign peoples**: Ezra's dramatic response to intermarriage (9-10)—public confession, communal repentance, dissolution of mixed marriages—reflects concern for maintaining distinct identity and avoiding pre-exilic apostasy patterns. This exclusivism, controversial today, addressed existential threat to small, vulnerable community. **Opposition and perseverance**: External enemies oppose rebuilding (ch. 4), but divine intervention and prophetic encouragement enable completion. **Worship and confession**: Communal worship (3:10-13), confession (9:6-15), and covenantal renewal mark restoration.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Ezra's historical framework receives substantial archaeological support. The **Cyrus Cylinder** (539 BCE), discovered in Babylon, confirms Cyrus's policy of returning exiled peoples and restoring their sanctuaries, providing context for Ezra 1:1-4 (though it doesn't mention Jews specifically). **Elephantine Papyri** (5th century BCE) from a Jewish military colony in Egypt confirm Persian-period Jewish life, mention Jerusalem temple and high priests, and show Persian administrative structures matching Ezra's descriptions. **Yehud coinage and seal impressions** from Persian-period Judah confirm the province's existence and governance. **Aramaic sections** (4:8-6:18; 7:12-26) reflect authentic Persian administrative language and practices. The **Passover Papyrus** from Elephantine shows Persian kings authorizing Jewish religious practices, paralleling Artaxerxes' authorization to Ezra. Archaeological surveys show limited settlement in Persian-period Judah centered around Jerusalem, consistent with the small, struggling community depicted. The temple's completion is confirmed by its existence in later periods. Debate continues over whether Ezra arrived under Artaxerxes I (458 BCE) or Artaxerxes II (398 BCE)—a 60-year difference affecting historical reconstruction.

**Structure:** 10 chapters in two main parts with 80-year gap between. **Part I: First Return and Temple Rebuilding (1-6):** Cyrus's decree and first return under Sheshbazzar/Zerubbabel with 42,360 people (chs. 1-2); altar rebuilding and foundation laying met with joy and tears (ch. 3); opposition from "adversaries" (Samaritans) disrupts work for 15+ years (ch. 4); prophets Haggai and Zechariah encourage resumption (ch. 5); Darius I confirms Cyrus's decree, temple completed in 6th year of Darius (515 BCE), Passover celebrated (ch. 6). **Part II: Ezra's Mission (7-10):** Introduction of Ezra with genealogy, Persian authorization, and Torah commission (ch. 7); second return with Ezra, 1,754 males plus women and children, four-month journey (ch. 8); crisis of intermarriage discovered, Ezra's public prayer and confession (ch. 9); communal repentance, covenant to divorce foreign wives, list of violators (ch. 10). The book's abrupt ending (mixed marriage dissolution) leaves narrative tension unresolved, perhaps requiring Nehemiah as continuation.

## Nehemiah

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Nehemiah recounts the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls (445 BCE) and religious reforms under Nehemiah's governorship of Yehud during the Persian period. The book's events occur in the 20th through 32nd years of Artaxerxes I (445-433 BCE), about 13 years after Ezra's arrival (if Ezra came in 458 BCE) or decades before Ezra (if Ezra came in 398 BCE under Artaxerxes II—chronological debate continues). Nehemiah, cupbearer to Artaxerxes I in the Persian capital Susa, receives distressing news about Jerusalem's ruined walls (1:1-3), obtains royal authorization to rebuild (2:1-8), travels to Jerusalem, and oversees 52-day wall reconstruction despite opposition from Sanballat (governor of Samaria), Tobiah (Ammonite official), and Geshem (Arabian leader). After completing walls, Nehemiah governs 12 years (445-433 BCE), returns to Persia, then revisits Jerusalem for further reforms (13:6-7). The book combines Nehemiah's first-person memoirs (the "Nehemiah Memoir," chs. 1-7, 11-13) with third-person narrative, lists, and material paralleling Ezra. Composition likely occurred soon after events (late 5th century BCE) incorporating Nehemiah's personal account, though final editing may have occurred later.

**Author and Audience:** The book's core derives from Nehemiah's first-person memoirs, offering rare ancient Near Eastern autobiography. Nehemiah's personal voice ("Remember me, O my God, for good," 5:19; 13:14, 22, 31) suggests he wrote his account, possibly as defense or report to Persian authorities, or as legacy document. A later editor combined Nehemiah's memoirs with additional material including genealogies (ch. 7, 11-12), Ezra material (ch. 8-10, overlapping Ezra's account), and community lists. Ancient tradition grouped Ezra-Nehemiah as single book (Hebrew Bible, LXX), though they now appear separately. The audience was the post-exilic Jewish community needing encouragement about their identity, security, and future under Persian rule. Nehemiah's successful appeal to Persian authority, wall completion despite opposition, and religious reforms provided model for post-exilic survival: maintain Jewish identity, practice Torah, accept Persian sovereignty while asserting communal boundaries, and trust divine provision through hostile circumstances.

**Key Themes:** **Prayer and divine providence**: Nehemiah constantly prays—before speaking to king (1:4-11), facing opposition (4:4-5, 9), making decisions (2:4; 5:19; 6:9, 14)—demonstrating dependence on God. **Leadership and courage**: Nehemiah's decisive action, strategic planning, personal sacrifice (not accepting governor's food allowance, 5:14-18), and confrontation of injustice model godly leadership. **Opposition and perseverance**: Despite mockery (2:19; 4:1-3), threats (4:7-12), rumors (6:5-9), and internal problems (5:1-5), Nehemiah perseveres through prayer, vigilance ("we prayed... and posted a guard," 4:9), and organization. **Community cooperation**: Rich and poor, priests and laypersons, men and women work together rebuilding (ch. 3 names participants by family/occupation). **Social justice**: Nehemiah confronts economic exploitation—wealthy Jews charging interest, taking property from poor—and demands restitution (ch. 5), demonstrating covenant community should protect vulnerable members. **Torah centrality**: Public Torah reading and interpretation (ch. 8, featuring Ezra), Feast of Tabernacles celebration, and covenantal renewal (ch. 9-10) establish Scripture as community foundation. **Separation and purity**: Concern for genealogical legitimacy, intermarriage prohibition, Sabbath observance, and temple purity (ch. 13) maintain distinct identity. **Remembrance**: Repeated "Remember me" prayers seek divine recognition of faithful service.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Nehemiah's account receives archaeological support and illumination. **Elephantine Papyri** mention Sanballat (Nehemiah's opponent) as governor of Samaria, confirming the book's political figures and administrative structures. A papyrus letter references "Johanan" as high priest (matching Nehemiah 12:22-23), providing chronological correlation. **Yehud province administration**: Seal impressions and coins marked "Yehud" confirm Persian-period Judean provincial system described in Nehemiah. **Jerusalem's walls**: Archaeological excavations by Kathleen Kenyon, Nahman Avigad, and others revealed Iron Age and Persian-period walls, though identifying specific construction to Nehemiah's time remains debated. The eastern slope's Nehemiah-era wall was narrower and less substantial than pre-exilic walls, consistent with a small, poor community. **Persian administrative titles**: Nehemiah's title "governor" (tirshatha/pehah) and references to provincial structures match Persian imperial organization documented archaeologically. **Opposition figures**: Sanballat (Samaria), Tobiah (Ammon), Geshem (Arabia/Kedar) represent historical figures confirmed or consistent with extra-biblical evidence. **Economic conditions**: Nehemiah's account of poverty, debt, and exploitation matches archaeological evidence of limited Persian-period Judean settlement and economic hardship. Dating debates continue, but the book's essential historicity is well-supported.

**Structure:** 13 chapters combining memoir, lists, and narrative: **Part I: Wall Rebuilding (1-7):** Nehemiah hears Jerusalem's plight (ch. 1), gains royal permission (ch. 2:1-8), inspects walls and organizes work (2:9-20), work proceeds with families assigned sections despite opposition (ch. 3-4), internal economic crisis resolved (ch. 5), completion despite plots against Nehemiah (ch. 6), list of returnees (ch. 7, paralleling Ezra 2). **Part II: Religious Renewal (8-10):** Torah reading by Ezra, communal weeping then joy (ch. 8), national confession recounting history (ch. 9), covenant renewal pledging Torah obedience, temple support, intermarriage avoidance (ch. 10). **Part III: Dedication and Reforms (11-13):** Repopulating Jerusalem (ch. 11), priestly and Levitical genealogies (ch. 12:1-26), wall dedication with processions (12:27-43), temple service organized (12:44-47), further reforms during Nehemiah's second visit: expelling Tobiah from temple, reinstating Levitical support, Sabbath enforcement, confronting intermarriage (ch. 13). The structure shows leadership (Nehemiah) combined with spiritual renewal (Ezra) producing community transformation.

### Nehemiah Chapter 11

And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts
to dwell in
other cities.
And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.
Now these
are the chief of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities,
to wit, Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon’s servants.
And at Jerusalem dwelt
certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah; Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalaleel, of the children of Perez;
And Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of Shiloni.
All the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem

Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hashub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites,
had
 the oversight of the outward business of the house of God.
And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph,
was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer: and Bakbukiah the second among his brethren, and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
All the Levites in the holy city
were two hundred fourscore and four.
Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that kept the gates,
were an hundred seventy and two.
And the residue of Israel, of the priests,

The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem
was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph, the singers
were over the business of the house of God.
For
it was the king’s commandment concerning them, that a certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day.
And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah,
was at the king’s hand in all matters concerning the people.
And for the villages, with their fields,
some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjath-arba, and
in the villages thereof, and at Dibon, and in the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel, and
in the villages thereof,
And at Jeshua, and at Moladah, and at Beth-phelet,
And at Hazar-shual, and at Beer-sheba, and
in the villages thereof,
And at Ziklag, and at Mekonah, and in the villages thereof,
And at En-rimmon, and at Zareah, and at Jarmuth,
Zanoah, Adullam, and
in their villages, at Lachish, and the fields thereof, at Azekah, and
in the villages thereof. And they dwelt from Beer-sheba unto the valley of Hinnom.
The children also of Benjamin from Geba
dwelt at Michmash, and Aija, and Bethel, and
in their villages,
And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,
Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.
And of the Levites
were divisions
in Judah,
and in Benjamin.


### Nehemiah Chapter 12

Now these
are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah,
Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,
Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These
were the chief of the priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.
Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah,
and Mattaniah,
which was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren.
Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren,
were over against them in the watches.
And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,
And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.
And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;
Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.
The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua,
were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the reign of Darius the Persian.
The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers,
were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise
and
 to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.
Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub,
were
 porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.
These
were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing,
with
 cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;
Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.
And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great
companies of them that gave thanks,
whereof one
 went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:
And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
And
certain of the priests’ sons with trumpets;
namely,
 Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:
And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.
And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.
And the other
company of them that gave thanks went over against
them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall;
And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.
So stood the two
companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:
And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah,
and Hananiah, with trumpets;
And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah
their overseer.
Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David,
and
 of Solomon his son.
For in the days of David and Asaph of old
there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.
And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified
holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified
them unto the children of Aaron.


### Nehemiah Chapter 13

On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;
Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.
Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God,
was allied unto Tobiah:
And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded
to be given
 to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.
But in all this
time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:
And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.
And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given
them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.
Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them
was
 Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office
was to distribute unto their brethren.
Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.
In those days saw I in Judah
some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all
manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified
against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.
There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing
is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?
Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and
some
 of my servants set I at the gates,
that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no
more on the sabbath.
And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and
that they should come
and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God,
concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.
In those days also saw I Jews
that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon,
and of Moab:
And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people.
And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God,
saying,
 Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.
Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.
Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?
And
one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest,
was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.
Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;
And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

## Esther

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Esther is set during the reign of Persian King Ahasuerus (Hebrew: Achashverosh), identified with Xerxes I (486-465 BCE) based on linguistic and historical correlations. The narrative occurs in the Persian capital Susa between Xerxes' 3rd and 12th years (483-473 BCE), specifically after his failed Greek invasion (480-479 BCE). The story's historicity is debated: some scholars view it as historical romance or wisdom tale with novelistic elements, while others defend core historical validity with legendary embellishment. Composition date ranges from Persian period (5th-4th centuries BCE) to Hellenistic period (3rd-2nd centuries BCE), with most scholars favoring late Persian or early Hellenistic authorship (4th century BCE). The book explains Purim festival origins, celebrated on Adar 14-15 (February-March). Notably, God is never explicitly mentioned in the Hebrew text—unique among biblical books—though divine providence is implied throughout. The Greek Septuagint adds extensive material including prayers and explicit God references, indicating discomfort with the Hebrew version's theological reticence.

**Author and Audience:** Authorship is anonymous, with no ancient tradition providing identification. The author demonstrates intimate knowledge of Persian court customs, palace architecture, administrative procedures, and protocol, suggesting either Persian-period Jewish courtier or later writer using Persian sources. The narrative's literary sophistication—irony, reversals, foreshadowing, wordplay—indicates skilled composition. Some scholars propose court chronicles or Persian sources underlie the account (10:2 references "book of the annals of the kings of Media and Persia"). The intended audience was diaspora Jewish communities, particularly Persian Jews, explaining their ethnic survival and celebrating deliverance from extinction through the Purim festival. The book addresses diaspora concerns: maintaining identity under foreign rule, antisemitism threats, divine protection despite apparent absence, and the possibility of Jewish flourishing in exile. Esther legitimizes diaspora existence—Jews need not return to Israel to experience divine care and can achieve prominence in pagan empires. The book's absence of explicit God language may reflect wisdom literature genre, Persian setting where naming God publicly was avoided, or universalizing tendencies making it accessible to Gentile audiences.

**Key Themes:** **Divine providence and hidden sovereignty**: Though God is never named, the book demonstrates divine control through "coincidences"—Esther's selection as queen, Mordecai discovering the plot, the king's sleeplessness leading him to remember Mordecai's loyalty, Haman's schemes backfiring—suggesting God works secretly to protect his people. **Reversal and poetic justice**: The narrative's driving pattern—what Haman intends for Mordecai happens to Haman (7:10, hanged on his own gallows), what Haman plans for Jews happens to enemies (9:1)—demonstrates moral universe where schemes against God's people rebound on perpetrators. **Courage and risk**: Esther's decision to approach the king unsummoned, risking death ("If I perish, I perish," 4:16), models courageous action for God's people. **Identity and assimilation**: Esther conceals her Jewish identity initially (2:10, 20) but ultimately reveals it to save her people, exploring tension between assimilation and maintaining distinct identity. **Antisemitism and Jewish survival**: Haman's genocidal plot represents existential threats Jews face in diaspora, while deliverance celebrates survival despite persecution. **Human responsibility and divine sovereignty**: Mordecai's charge to Esther—"who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this?" (4:14)—combines human agency with divine providence. **Fasting and community**: Corporate fasting (4:15-16) becomes substitute for prayer, maintaining religious dimension despite God's absence from text. **Vindication and celebration**: Purim festival celebrates Jewish survival and triumph, incorporating feasting, gift-giving, and charity.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Esther's Persian setting finds substantial archaeological corroboration, though specific characters and events lack independent verification. **Xerxes I (Ahasuerus)**: Extra-biblical sources (Herodotus, Persian inscriptions, Greek historians) confirm Xerxes ruled 486-465 BCE over vast empire from India to Ethiopia matching biblical description. **Susa palace**: Archaeological excavations by French and Iranian teams revealed Xerxes' winter palace at Susa matching architectural details in Esther—elaborate columned halls, royal courtyards, separate women's quarters, administrative buildings. Inscriptions confirm Persian administrative structures and royal protocols described. **Persian customs**: The book accurately reflects Persian court life—lengthy banquets, royal edicts, postal system (8:10, royal couriers on swift horses), king's inability to revoke edicts (8:8), and extensive record-keeping (2:23; 6:1; 10:2). **Names**: "Mordecai" appears in Persian period documents as a Jewish name, and "Marduk" elements in Babylonian-Persian names are attested. **Absence of historical confirmation**: No extra-biblical source mentions Vashti, Esther, Haman, or Mordecai. Herodotus names Xerxes' queen as Amestris, not Esther/Vashti, creating historical problems—either Esther is literary fiction, represents minor wife not mentioned by Herodotus, or Herodotus confused details. The edict permitting Jews to defend themselves and kill 75,000 enemies (9:16) lacks corroboration and raises historical questions. Most scholars view Esther as historicized fiction—Persian setting is authentic, but plot and characters are literary creation explaining Purim origins.

**Structure:** 10 chapters with symmetrical plot structure emphasizing reversal: **Exposition (1-2):** King Ahasuerus deposes Queen Vashti for disobedience (ch. 1); Esther, a Jewish orphan raised by Mordecai, becomes queen, concealing her ethnicity (ch. 2); Mordecai discovers assassination plot, saving the king. **Rising Conflict (3-4):** Haman, elevated to highest noble position, demands obeisance; Mordecai refuses (Jewish unable to bow to humans?); enraged, Haman plots genocide of all Jews, obtaining royal edict (ch. 3); Mordecai enlists Esther to intervene, despite risk (ch. 4). **Turning Point (5-7):** Esther hosts banquets for king and Haman; Haman builds gallows for Mordecai (ch. 5); sleepless king discovers Mordecai's unrewarded loyalty, forcing Haman to honor Mordecai publicly (ch. 6); at second banquet, Esther reveals identity and Haman's plot; Haman is hanged on his own gallows (ch. 7). **Resolution (8-10):** Mordecai elevated to Haman's position; king issues new edict allowing Jewish self-defense (ch. 8); Jews defend themselves, killing enemies including Haman's sons (ch. 9:1-15); Purim festival established celebrating deliverance (9:16-32); Mordecai's greatness confirmed (ch. 10). The chiastic structure centers on the king's sleeplessness (ch. 6), the pivot point transforming situation from threat to deliverance.

### Esther Chapter 1

Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this
is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia,
over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)
That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which
was in Shushan the palace,
In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces,
being before him:
When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days,
even an hundred and fourscore days.
And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace;
Where were white, green, and blue,
hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds
were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.
And they gave
them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.
And the drinking
was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.
Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women
in the royal house which
belonged to king Ahasuerus.
On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she
was fair to look on.
But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by
his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.
Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so
was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:
And the next unto him
was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena,
and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king’s face,
and which sat the first in the kingdom;)
What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that
are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
For
this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.
Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king’s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus
shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.
If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.
And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.
And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
For he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that
it should be published according to the language of every people.


### Esther Chapter 2

After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:
And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women unto the custody of Hege the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given
them:
And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
          Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name
was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;
Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
And he brought up Hadassah, that
is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid
was
 fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.
So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens,
which were meet to be given her, out of the king’s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best
place
 of the house of the women.
Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew
it.
And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.
Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished,
to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with
other things for the purifying of the women;)
Then thus came
every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house.
In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.
Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which
is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants,
even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.
And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.
Esther had not
yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.
In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king
thereof in Mordecai’s name.
And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.


### Esther Chapter 3

After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that
were with him.
And all the king’s servants, that
were in the king’s gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did
him reverence.
Then the king’s servants, which
were in the king’s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king’s commandment?
Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s matters would stand: for he had told them that he
was a Jew.
And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that
were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus,
even
 the people of Mordecai.
In the first month, that
is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that
is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month,
to the twelfth
month, that
is, the month Adar.
And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws
are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it
is not for the king’s profit to suffer them.
If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring
it into the king’s treasuries.
And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.
And the king said unto Haman, The silver
is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors that
were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and
to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king’s ring.
And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day,
even upon the thirteenth
day
 of the twelfth month, which
is the month Adar, and
to take the spoil of them for a prey.
The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.
The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.


### Esther Chapter 4

When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
And came even before the king’s gate: for none
might enter into the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.
And in every province, whithersoever the king’s commandment and his decree came,
there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told
it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received
it
 not.
Then called Esther for Hatach,
one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it
was, and why it
was.
So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which
was before the king’s gate.
And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew
it unto Esther, and to declare
it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.
And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;
All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called,
there is one law of his to put
him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.
And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews.
For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time,
then
 shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for
such a time as this?
Then Esther bade
them return Mordecai
this answer,
Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which
is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.
So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.

## Haggai

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Haggai is precisely dated to the second year of Darius I of Persia (520 BCE), with four prophetic oracles delivered over four months (August-December 520 BCE, using precise month-day notation: 1:1 [first day, sixth month]; 1:15-2:1 [twenty-first day, seventh month]; 2:10 [twenty-fourth day, ninth month]; 2:20 [twenty-fourth day, ninth month]). This dating places Haggai's ministry 18 years after Cyrus's 538 BCE edict allowing exiles to return and rebuild the Jerusalem Temple (Ezra 1:1-4, 6:3-5). The returning community under Sheshbazzar and later Zerubbabel had laid Temple foundations (Ezra 3:8-13, 5:16) but abandoned construction due to opposition from local populations (Ezra 4:1-5, 24) and economic hardship (Haggai 1:6, 9-11). Haggai's preaching broke this 18-year paralysis, successfully motivating Zerubbabel (Persian-appointed governor, Davidic descendant) and Joshua (high priest) to resume Temple reconstruction in 520 BCE, with completion in 515 BCE (Ezra 6:15). Haggai was contemporary with Zechariah, whose ministry began two months after Haggai's (Zechariah 1:1), both prophets mentioned together in Ezra 5:1-2, 6:14. The historical context involves Persian imperial consolidation: Darius I faced revolts throughout his empire (522-520 BCE) after usurping the throne, documented in the **Behistun Inscription**. Haggai 2:6-7, 21-22 references shaking nations and overthrowing kingdoms, possibly alluding to this instability and raising messianic hopes around Zerubbabel (2:23).

**Author and Audience:** Traditional attribution identifies Haggai the prophet (1:1), though the book is written in third person, suggesting disciples compiled his oracles. "Haggai" (Hebrew haggay) means "festal" or "born on a festival," possibly indicating birth during a pilgrimage feast. Nothing is known of Haggai's background beyond his prophetic role; Jewish tradition (Talmud, b. Megillah 14b) speculates he returned from Babylonian exile as an old man who remembered Solomon's Temple (implied by 2:3's address to those who "saw this house in its former glory"). Haggai addressed the Jerusalem community of returned exiles, specifically targeting leaders Zerubbabel ben Shealtiel (grandson of King Jehoiachin, 1 Chronicles 3:17-19, part of David's line) and Joshua ben Jehozadak the high priest (1:1, 12, 14; 2:2, 4). His broader audience included priests (2:11-14), "the remnant of the people" (1:12, 14; 2:2), and those discouraged by the modest Temple compared to Solomon's former glory (2:3). Haggai's message combined rebuke (prioritizing personal houses over God's house), encouragement (God's presence despite modest appearance), and eschatological hope (future glory and Davidic restoration). The book's preservation evidences its importance: Haggai succeeded where 18 years of inaction preceded him, mobilizing the community to complete the central symbol of post-exilic Jewish identity. His emphasis on Temple-centered worship shaped Second Temple Judaism.

**Key Themes:** **Temple Priority**: Haggai's central message demands Temple reconstruction take priority over personal prosperity. The community's logic – "The time has not yet come to rebuild the LORD's house" (1:2) – while they "dwell in paneled houses" (1:4) reveals misplaced priorities. Economic hardship (crop failure, inflation, 1:6, 9-11) is divinely caused judgment for Temple neglect. **Divine Presence**: The Second Temple may lack the Shekinah glory, ark, or grandeur of Solomon's Temple (2:3, 9), yet God promises "My Spirit remains in your midst" (2:5) and future glory that will "surpass the former" (2:9). God's presence, not architectural splendor, matters most. **Covenant Continuity**: Haggai invokes Exodus covenant language ("I am with you," 1:13; 2:4-5, recalling God's Sinai promise), connecting post-exilic community to Israel's foundational salvation history despite exile's apparent covenant rupture. **Eschatological Hope**: Haggai prophesies cosmic upheaval: "I will shake the heavens and the earth" (2:6, 21, quoted in Hebrews 12:26-27), overthrow kingdoms (2:22), and bring "the treasures of all nations" to fill the Temple with glory (2:7). **Messianic Expectation**: The book climaxes with Zerubbabel designated God's "signet ring" (2:23), royal imagery (compare Jeremiah 22:24 removing Jehoiachin as signet) raising hopes of Davidic restoration. Though Zerubbabel disappears from historical record (possibly removed by Persians for raising messianic expectations), his prominence kept Davidic hopes alive, eventually fulfilled in Jesus (Matthew 1:12-13 lists Zerubbabel in Jesus's genealogy).

**Archaeological Relevance:** Haggai's 520 BCE setting receives archaeological and textual corroboration. **Yehud Stamps**: Post-exilic administrative jar handle impressions stamped "Yehud" (Aramaic for "Judah") evidence Persian-period Judean province administration, the political context for Zerubbabel's governorship. These stamps confirm reduced territorial extent (compared to pre-exilic Judah) and Persian imperial control. **Elephantine Papyri**: Aramaic documents from Jewish military colony at Elephantine (Egypt, 5th century BCE) reference the Jerusalem Temple, show diaspora Jews sought Jerusalem's authority, and document Persian-period religious practices, illustrating the Temple's centrality for Jewish identity that Haggai championed. **Behistun Inscription**: Darius I's massive trilingual (Old Persian, Elamite, Akkadian) rock inscription in Iran documents his accession (522 BCE) and suppression of revolts throughout the empire (521-520 BCE), the "shaking of nations" context for Haggai 2:6-7, 21-22. The instability may have fueled Jewish messianic hopes around Zerubbabel. **Persian Administrative Records**: The **Cyrus Cylinder** (538 BCE) documents Cyrus's policy of restoring temples and repatriating displaced peoples, the policy background for the Temple rebuilding project Haggai champions. Ezra 6:2 mentions finding Cyrus's decree in Ecbatana archives; while the decree itself hasn't been found, the Cylinder evidences such policies. **Second Temple Architecture**: Archaeological remains of the Second Temple are limited (Herodian expansion obscures earlier phases), but evidence from Temple Mount excavations, Josephus's descriptions, and later sources suggest modest beginnings matching Haggai 2:3's lament. **Economic Hardship**: Haggai 1:6, 9-11 describes crop failure, inflation, and economic distress. Archaeobotanical studies and settlement patterns show Persian-period Yehud was impoverished compared to pre-exilic Judah, with reduced population, smaller settlements, and lower agricultural productivity – context for community's discouragement.

**Structure:** Haggai's brief 2 chapters (38 verses) contain four precisely-dated prophetic oracles. **Oracle 1 (1:1-15): Call to Rebuild** opens on day one, month six, year two of Darius (August 29, 520 BCE), rebuking the community for prioritizing personal houses over the Temple (1:2-4), diagnosing economic hardship as divine judgment for Temple neglect (1:5-11), and recording Zerubbabel and Joshua's obedient response mobilizing workers to resume construction 24 days later (September 21, 520 BCE, 1:12-15). **Oracle 2 (2:1-9): Encouragement Amid Discouragement** comes on day twenty-one, month seven (October 17, 520 BCE, during Sukkot/Tabernacles), addressing those discouraged by the modest Temple compared to Solomon's glory (2:3), encouraging them with divine presence ("My Spirit remains," 2:5) and promising future glory surpassing the former Temple when God shakes nations and brings their treasures (2:6-9). **Oracle 3 (2:10-19): From Uncleanness to Blessing** on day twenty-four, month nine (December 18, 520 BCE) uses priestly torah (ruling) on ritual contagion as metaphor: uncleanness spreads easily while holiness doesn't (2:11-14), applying this to the Temple – its absence contaminated everything, but its reconstruction begins divine blessing, observable "from this day on" (2:15-19). **Oracle 4 (2:20-23): Messianic Promise to Zerubbabel** comes the same day (December 18, 520 BCE), promising to shake heavens, earth, and kingdoms, overthrowing thrones (2:21-22), and designating Zerubbabel as God's "signet ring," chosen servant (2:23), royal imagery suggesting Davidic restoration hopes. The book's tight chronological structure (four months) and precise dating (unique in Hebrew Bible) underscore historical specificity and successful completion of mission – Temple construction resumed and finished within Haggai's lifetime (515 BCE).

## Zechariah

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Zechariah's ministry began two months after Haggai's in the eighth month of Darius I's second year (October/November 520 BCE, 1:1), continuing through the ninth month of the fourth year (December 518 BCE, 7:1), a two-year period accompanying Temple reconstruction (520-515 BCE). Like Haggai, Zechariah addressed the post-exilic community struggling with Temple rebuilding, but while Haggai preached practical exhortation, Zechariah delivered elaborate apocalyptic visions offering cosmic perspective on seemingly mundane construction. Critical scholarship distinguishes Proto-Zechariah (chs 1-8, dated 520-518 BCE) from Deutero-Zechariah (chs 9-14, undated, possibly 5th-3rd centuries BCE), noting literary, thematic, and linguistic differences. Chapters 1-8 contain eight night visions (1:7-6:15) framed by call to repentance (1:1-6) and questions about fasting (7:1-8:23), all set in specific dates during Darius's reign. Chapters 9-14 contain two "oracles" (massa', 9:1, 12:1) without dates or named prophets, featuring eschatological battles, messianic imagery, and apocalyptic themes. Conservative scholars defend unity, attributing chapters 9-14 to the same Zechariah in later life, while critical consensus views them as later anonymous additions. The book's New Testament quotations (especially chapters 9-14: triumphal entry on donkey [9:9 = Matthew 21:5], thirty pieces of silver [11:12-13 = Matthew 27:9], piercing [12:10 = John 19:37], striking the shepherd [13:7 = Matthew 26:31]) suggest early acceptance as authoritative prophecy regardless of authorship debates.

**Author and Audience:** Zechariah is identified as "son of Berechiah, son of Iddo" (1:1), from a priestly family (Nehemiah 12:4, 16 lists Iddo among returning priests; Ezra 5:1, 6:14 call him "son of Iddo," possibly meaning grandson). His dual priestly-prophetic role (like Jeremiah and Ezekiel) shaped his Temple-centered message and detailed knowledge of cultic matters (3:1-10, 6:9-15). "Zechariah" (Hebrew zekaryah) means "Yahweh remembers," a programmatic name for post-exilic restoration theology. Like Haggai, Zechariah addressed the Jerusalem community under Governor Zerubbabel and High Priest Joshua (3:1-10, 4:6-10, 6:11-13), encouraging Temple completion amid discouragement, opposition, and limited resources. His visions reinterpret recent history (exile, return) and present circumstances (modest Temple, Persian rule, Davidic hopes) through apocalyptic symbolism, making divine purposes visible. Chapters 9-14, if later, address a community facing continued foreign domination (Greek period?), internal corruption, false prophecy, and delayed messianic fulfillment, offering hope through eschatological upheaval. Zechariah's influence extended significantly: his apocalyptic imagery (four horns, Branch, two anointed ones, Shepherd, piercing) shaped Jewish and Christian messianic interpretation, with heavy New Testament usage (Matthew, John, Revelation cite Zechariah over 40 times). His visions bridge post-exilic restoration and eschatological consummation.

**Key Themes:** **Divine Jealousy and Return**: God is "exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion" (1:14, 8:2), having returned to his people and city after exile judgment (1:16, 8:3). Temple rebuilding symbolizes restored divine presence. **Visions of Restoration**: Eight night visions communicate God's plans: horsemen patrol the earth reporting peace (1:7-17); four horns (nations) that scattered Judah are cast down by four craftsmen (1:18-21); Jerusalem measured without walls due to divine protection (2:1-13); Joshua cleansed and crowned (3:1-10); golden lampstand and two olive trees symbolizing Spirit-empowered witness (4:1-14); flying scroll brings covenant curse on oath-breakers and thieves (5:1-4); woman in ephah (Wickedness) exiled to Babylon (5:5-11); four chariots patrol cardinal directions (6:1-8). **Messianic Hope - Branch and Priest-King**: The "Branch" (tsemakh, 3:8, 6:12) represents Davidic messiah (compare Isaiah 4:2, 11:1, Jeremiah 23:5, 33:15) who will "build the temple of the LORD" and "sit and rule on his throne," uniquely combining kingship and priesthood (6:13). Zerubbabel is identified with this building role (4:9), though the expectation transcends him. **Two Anointed Ones**: The vision of lampstand with two olive trees (4:1-14) represents Joshua and Zerubbabel as "the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth" (4:14), joint leadership (priestly-political) of restoration community. **Ethical Religion**: Fasting without justice, mercy, and righteousness is meaningless (7:4-10, 8:16-17), echoing pre-exilic prophetic critique (Isaiah, Amos, Micah). **Universal Kingship**: The LORD will be "king over all the earth" (14:9); nations will come to Jerusalem to worship (8:20-23, 14:16); even former enemies will become part of God's people (9:7). **Eschatological Battle and Deliverance**: Chapters 12-14 describe apocalyptic warfare where Jerusalem is besieged but divinely delivered, climaxing in universal recognition of Yahweh's sovereignty.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Zechariah's Persian-period setting receives archaeological corroboration. **Persian Administration**: **Yehud stamps** and **Paleo-Hebrew coinage** evidence the autonomous province status Zechariah's community held under Persian oversight, with governors like Zerubbabel maintaining limited self-governance. **Temple Rebuilding**: Zechariah 4:9 promises "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it." While Second Temple archaeology is obscured by later Herodian construction, **Persian-period installations** beneath the Temple Mount platform, **coins**, and **pottery** confirm 520-515 BCE reconstruction activity matching Zechariah-Haggai chronology. **Behistun Inscription**: Darius I's trilingual monument documenting empire-wide revolts (522-520 BCE) provides backdrop for Zechariah 1:11's vision of divine horsemen reporting "all the earth remains at rest" – ironic given recent upheaval, suggesting God's timing differs from human expectations. **Elephantine Papyri**: 5th century BCE Aramaic documents from Egyptian Jewish military colony show Persian-period diaspora seeking Jerusalem Temple authority, illustrating the restored Temple's centrality for Jewish identity that Zechariah championed. **Greek Period Indicators**: If chapters 9-14 date later, references to "Javan" (Greece, 9:13) and absence of specific Persian references may reflect Hellenistic period (post-330 BCE), though this remains debated. **Economic Conditions**: Zechariah 8:10-12 describes prior economic hardship ("no wages for man or beast") transitioning to promised prosperity, matching Persian-period Yehud's impoverished archaeological profile (small settlements, reduced population, low material culture) gradually recovering from exilic devastation. **Messianic Imagery**: Zechariah 9:9's king "humble and riding on a donkey" echoes ancient Near Eastern royal iconography (donkeys as royal mounts) while subverting militaristic expectations, imagery Jesus enacted (Matthew 21:1-11, Mark 11:1-11).

**Structure:** Zechariah's 14 chapters divide clearly into two sections. **Part I: Proto-Zechariah (Chapters 1-8)** dates precisely to 520-518 BCE and contains: Call to covenant faithfulness (1:1-6), opening with "Return to me... and I will return to you" (1:3), warning against repeating ancestral disobedience; Eight Night Visions (1:7-6:15) received on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month in Darius's second year (February 15, 519 BCE): (1) horsemen among myrtles report earth at rest (1:7-17); (2) four horns and four craftsmen show judgment on Judah's oppressors (1:18-21); (3) measuring Jerusalem for expansion (2:1-13); (4) Joshua cleansed and crowned as high priest (3:1-10); (5) golden lampstand and two olive trees representing Spirit-empowered witness (4:1-14); (6) flying scroll bringing covenant curses (5:1-4); (7) woman in ephah (Wickedness) exiled to Shinar/Babylon (5:5-11); (8) four chariots patrolling earth (6:1-8), followed by symbolic crowning of Joshua with messianic "Branch" oracle (6:9-15); Fasting Questions and Ethical Requirements (7:1-8:23) set in the ninth month of Darius's fourth year (December 7, 518 BCE), questioning whether to continue exile-related fasts now that Temple rebuilds, answered with demands for justice, mercy, and truth (7:4-14) and promises of Jerusalem's future glory with nations seeking the LORD (8:1-23). **Part II: Deutero-Zechariah (Chapters 9-14)** lacks dates, names, or historical specifics, comprising two "oracles" (massa'): First Oracle (9:1-11:17) includes judgment on surrounding nations (9:1-8), messianic king entering on donkey (9:9-10), deliverance and restoration (9:11-17), divine visitation bringing agricultural abundance (10:1-12), and allegory of shepherds (11:1-17) depicting failed leadership; Second Oracle (12:1-14:21) describes eschatological Jerusalem siege and deliverance (12:1-9), mourning for "him whom they have pierced" (12:10-14), cleansing from sin and idolatry (13:1-6), striking the shepherd and scattering the flock (13:7-9), and climactic Day of the LORD when God fights for Jerusalem, becoming king over all earth with universal worship (14:1-21). The structural break between chapters 8 and 9 is stark, supporting two-part authorship/redaction theory, though both sections share Temple-centered, eschatological, and messianic concerns.

## Malachi

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Malachi is difficult to date precisely as it lacks superscription with regnal dating. Internal evidence suggests mid-5th century BCE, post-dating Haggai-Zechariah (Temple rebuilt, 515 BCE, since sacrifices occur, 1:7-10) but likely preceding Ezra-Nehemiah's reforms (458-445 BCE or 398 BCE depending on Ezra's date). The book addresses Temple abuses (1:6-2:9), intermarriage with foreign women (2:10-16), and failure to tithe (3:8-10) – the same issues Ezra-Nehemiah confronted (Ezra 9-10, Nehemiah 13). Malachi's criticism that priests despise God's name (1:6), offer polluted sacrifices (1:7-8), and fail to teach properly (2:7-8) matches Nehemiah 13:4-31's reforms targeting priestly corruption. The presence of a "governor" (pehah, 1:8) indicates Persian provincial administration. Scholarly consensus dates Malachi to 500-450 BCE, with some preferring 460-450 BCE just before Ezra's arrival. This places Malachi during a period of disillusionment: initial post-exilic enthusiasm (Haggai-Zechariah) had faded, promised prosperity hadn't materialized (3:14-15), and cynicism about divine justice prevailed ("Where is the God of justice?" 2:17). Malachi's name ("my messenger," mal'aki) may be symbolic rather than personal, as it echoes 3:1 ("Behold, I send my messenger"). The Septuagint translates it as common noun ("his messenger") rather than proper name. Whether personal name or title, "Malachi" concludes the prophetic corpus with a message bridging Old and New Testaments, the last prophetic voice before the "400 silent years" until John the Baptist, whom Jesus identifies with Malachi's Elijah prophecy (Matthew 11:10-14, 17:10-13).

**Author and Audience:** The book provides no biographical information about its prophet. "Malachi" may be a personal name, a title ("my messenger"), or an anonymous prophetic figure. Jewish tradition (Targum Jonathan) identified Malachi with Ezra, though this is unlikely given genre and style differences. The book addresses the post-exilic Jerusalem community, specifically indicting priests who despise God's name (1:6), offer defective sacrifices (1:8, 13), and fail to instruct properly (2:8-9), and laypeople who divorce Israelite wives to marry foreign women (2:10-16), fail to tithe (3:8), and question God's justice (2:17, 3:14-15). The audience is "Jacob" (1:2, 2:12, 3:6) and "Israel" (1:1, 5, 2:11, 16), though geographically limited to Judah/Jerusalem. Malachi's disputational style – stating divine claim, anticipating audience objection ("But you say..."), then answering – suggests a community questioning God's love (1:2), the worthiness of proper worship (1:13), and the value of serving God faithfully when wicked prosper (3:14-15). The prophet addresses a disillusioned people: economic struggles continue despite Temple reconstruction, foreign oppression persists under Persian rule, and expected messianic deliverance hasn't occurred. Malachi both rebukes this cynicism and promises imminent divine intervention: the messenger will prepare the way, the Lord will suddenly come to his Temple, and Elijah will precede the "great and awesome day of the LORD" (3:1, 4:5). Early Christianity saw John the Baptist fulfilling the Elijah prophecy (Matthew 11:14, 17:11-13; Luke 1:17), with Jesus as the coming Lord (Mark 1:2-3 conflates Malachi 3:1 and Isaiah 40:3).

**Key Themes:** **God's Electing Love**: The book opens affirming God's love for Israel, proven by choosing Jacob over Esau (1:2-5), despite audience doubts ("How have you loved us?" 1:2). God's past election grounds future hope. **Dishonoring God's Name**: Priests "despise" God's name by offering blind, lame, sick animals (1:6-8, 13-14), violating Mosaic law requiring unblemished sacrifices (Leviticus 22:17-25, Deuteronomy 15:21). Such offerings insult God and would be rejected by human governors (1:8), showing religious hypocrisy. Malachi prophesies God's name will be "great among the nations" (1:11, 14), universalizing worship. **Covenant with Levi**: God made a covenant with Levi for "life and peace" (2:5), requiring priests to guard knowledge and teach Torah faithfully (2:7). Current priests violate this covenant by causing "many to stumble" through poor instruction (2:8-9), echoing Ezekiel 44:23's priestly responsibility. **Marriage and Divorce**: Malachi uniquely addresses divorce, condemning those who "cover their garments with violence" by divorcing "the wife of your youth" (2:13-16), declaring "I hate divorce" (2:16). This connects to intermarriage criticism (2:10-12), suggesting Israelite men divorced Jewish wives to marry foreign women, violating covenant community boundaries (compare Ezra 9-10, Nehemiah 13:23-27). **Divine Justice and Judgment**: The community questions God's justice: "Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD... or where is the God of justice?" (2:17). Malachi promises the Lord will "suddenly come to his temple" as "refiner's fire" to purify Levites and judge evildoers (3:1-5, 3:16-4:3). **Tithes and Offerings**: The people "rob God" by withholding tithes and offerings (3:8-10), invited to "test" God by bringing full tithe and seeing blessing (3:10). **Day of the LORD**: The book concludes with the "great and awesome day of the LORD" (4:5), preceded by Elijah who will "turn the hearts of fathers to children" (4:6), lest God "strike the land with a decree of utter destruction." This eschatological expectation bridges testaments.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Malachi's mid-5th century BCE setting receives modest archaeological corroboration. **Edom's Destruction**: Malachi 1:3-4 declares God "hated Esau" and made Edom "a waste." Archaeological surveys and excavations show Edomite settlement collapse in 6th-5th centuries BCE, possibly from Nabataean Arab pressure, confirming Edom's diminished state compared to pre-exilic power. Edomite refugees settled in southern Judah (becoming "Idumea"), evidenced by Edomite pottery, names in ostraca, and settlement patterns. Malachi's audience could witness Edom's desolation as sign of divine judgment. **Persian Administration**: The reference to "governor" (pehah, 1:8) reflects Persian provincial system. **Yehud stamps** (jar handles stamped with "Yehud," Aramaic for "Judah") evidence administrative structure in which Malachi's community lived. Persian-period Jerusalem was modest, with reduced territory and population compared to pre-exilic Judah, context for economic struggles prompting tithing failures (3:8-10) and cynicism about serving God (3:14-15). **Second Temple Worship**: Malachi presupposes functioning Temple cult with altar, priests, sacrifices (1:7-10, 3:1, 10). Archaeological evidence for Second Temple period comes from **Temple Mount excavations** (limited due to site sensitivity), **ritual baths (mikva'ot)** around Jerusalem, and **written sources** (Elephantine papyri referencing Jerusalem Temple). The modest nature of early Second Temple (noted in Haggai 2:3) may contribute to priestly laxness Malachi condemns. **Intermarriage Concerns**: Malachi 2:11 condemns marrying "the daughter of a foreign god," matching Ezra-Nehemiah's campaigns against intermarriage (Ezra 9-10, Nehemiah 13:23-30). **Elephantine papyri** evidence intermarriage in diaspora communities, illustrating the concern for maintaining covenant boundaries in contexts of foreign religious influence. **Economic Conditions**: Malachi 3:11 promises God will "rebuke the devourer" threatening crops, and 3:12 envisions agricultural abundance. Persian-period Yehud's limited agricultural productivity, evidenced archaeologically through settlement patterns and paleobotanical data, explains why withholding tithes seemed financially necessary (3:8) even as Malachi argues it causes divine curse (3:9).

**Structure:** Malachi's 4 chapters (3 chapters in Hebrew Bible, which combines 3:19-24 as chapter 4 in Christian Bibles) comprise six disputations following question-answer format. **Disputation 1 (1:2-5): God's Love for Israel** – Divine claim: "I have loved you"; Objection: "How have you loved us?"; Answer: I chose Jacob over Esau, proven by Edom's desolation. **Disputation 2 (1:6-2:9): Priests Despise God's Name** – Claim: "A son honors his father... where is my honor?"; Objection (implied): We haven't despised your name; Answer: You offer polluted sacrifices (blind, lame, sick animals), making offerings contemptible; Consequence: Covenant with Levi broken, priests cursed. **Disputation 3 (2:10-16): Covenant Breaking Through Divorce/Intermarriage** – Why do we "deal treacherously" with one another? Answer: Intermarriage with foreign women profanes holiness, divorce violates covenant; God hates divorce and treachery. **Disputation 4 (2:17-3:5): Divine Justice** – Claim: "You have wearied the LORD"; Objection: "How have we wearied him?"; Answer: By saying evildoers are good in God's sight and asking "Where is the God of justice?"; Divine response: "The Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple" as refiner's fire to judge. **Disputation 5 (3:6-12): Robbing God Through Withheld Tithes** – Claim: "Return to me"; Objection: "How shall we return?"; Answer: Stop robbing God in tithes and offerings; Promise: Bring full tithe and see blessing. **Disputation 6 (3:13-4:3 [3:13-21 Hebrew]): Questioning God's Service** – Claim: "Your words have been hard against me"; Objection: "How have we spoken against you?"; Answer: You say serving God is vain and evildoers prosper; Divine response: A book of remembrance records the faithful; the Day of the LORD will distinguish righteous from wicked. **Conclusion (4:4-6 [3:22-24 Hebrew]): Final Exhortations** – Remember Moses's Torah; Behold, Elijah comes before the great Day of the LORD to reconcile families, lest God strike the land with destruction. This ending bridges testaments, pointing forward to John the Baptist and Jesus (Matthew 11:10-14, 17:10-13, Mark 1:2, Luke 1:17).

### Malachi Chapter 1

The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.
I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us?
Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,
And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.
Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.
And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.
A son honoureth
his father, and a servant his master: if then I
be a father, where
is mine honour? and if I
be
 a master, where
is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?
Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD
is contemptible.
And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice,
is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick,
is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.
And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.
Who
is there even among you that would shut the doors
for nought? neither do ye kindle
fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name
shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense
shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name
shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.
But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD
is polluted; and the fruit thereof,
even his meat,
is contemptible.
Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness
is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought
that which was
 torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.
But cursed
be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I
am
 a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name
is dreadful among the heathen.


### Malachi Chapter 2

And now, O ye priests, this commandment
is for you.
If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay
it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay
it to heart.
Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces,
even the dung of your solemn feasts; and
one shall take you away with it.
And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.
My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him
for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.
The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.
For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he
is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.
But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.
Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.
Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?
Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.
The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.
And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth
it with good will at your hand.
Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet
is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.
And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for
one covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.
Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied
him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil
is
 good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where
is the God of judgment?


### Malachi Chapter 3

Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.
But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he
is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ sope:
And he shall sit
as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.
Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.
And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in
his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger
from his right,
 and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.
For I
am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.
Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept
them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?
Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
Ye
are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me,
even
 this whole nation.
Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that
there shall not
be room enough
to receive it.
And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.
And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.
Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken
so much against thee?
Ye have said, It
is vain to serve God: and what profit
is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?
And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea,
they that tempt God are even delivered.
Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard
it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.
And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.
Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.


### Malachi Chapter 4

For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.
And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do
this, saith the LORD of hosts.
Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel,
with the statutes and judgments.
Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:
And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.

## Part 10: Wisdom Literature

### Historical and Cultural Background: Wisdom Literature

**Historical Context (Varied Composition: 10th-3rd centuries BCE)**

Wisdom Literature represents a distinct genre within the Hebrew Bible, comprising Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, and portions of the Psalms. Unlike narrative or prophetic books rooted in specific historical events, wisdom literature addresses universal human concerns through philosophical reflection, practical guidance, and poetic expression. The dating of these books varies significantly: Proverbs contains collections attributed to Solomon (10th century BCE) but likely compiled over centuries with final redaction during the post-exilic period (5th-4th centuries BCE). Job's dating is intensely debated, with proposals ranging from the Patriarchal period (2nd millennium BCE) based on its setting, to the monarchic period (7th-6th centuries BCE) based on linguistic features, to post-exilic composition (5th-4th centuries BCE) based on theological sophistication. Ecclesiastes (Qoheleth) is generally dated to the Persian or early Hellenistic period (4th-3rd centuries BCE) based on linguistic features including Persian and possibly Greek loanwords. Song of Solomon's dating ranges from Solomonic (10th century BCE) to post-exilic (5th-4th centuries BCE). Wisdom literature shares characteristics with international wisdom traditions found throughout the ancient Near East, including Egyptian instruction texts (Teaching of Amenemope, influential on Proverbs 22:17-24:22), Mesopotamian wisdom texts (Ludlul Bel Nemeqi, "I Will Praise the Lord of Wisdom," paralleling Job), and Akkadian proverb collections. The wisdom tradition represents a more universal, less nationalistic perspective than other biblical genres, focusing on human experience, natural order, and the search for meaning rather than covenant history and law.

**Geographic Setting**

Wisdom Literature's geographic focus differs from other biblical texts by emphasizing universal human experience rather than Israel's specific geographic story. Job is explicitly set outside Israel in the "land of Uz," possibly Edom or northern Arabia, with characters who are non-Israelites, emphasizing wisdom's international scope. The book references distant lands including Sheba, Tema, and Egypt, reflecting awareness of broader ancient Near Eastern geography. Proverbs, traditionally associated with Solomon's court in Jerusalem, reflects both urban and rural Palestinian settings, with references to agriculture, city gates (where elders adjudicated disputes), royal courts, and trade. Ecclesiastes shows awareness of broader Mediterranean culture, possibly reflecting Jerusalem's exposure to Hellenistic influences in the Persian or early Hellenistic period. Song of Solomon celebrates Palestinian geography through poetic imagery: vineyards of En-gedi, cedars of Lebanon, gardens, mountains, pastoral settings around Jerusalem. The wisdom books' geographic scope extends beyond national boundaries to encompass humanity universally, though grounded in the physical and cultural landscapes of ancient Israel and its neighbors. Wisdom schools likely existed in major urban centers like Jerusalem, where scribal training occurred under royal and later priestly patronage, similar to Egyptian and Mesopotamian scribal schools discovered archaeologically at sites like Mari, Nippur, and throughout Egypt.

**Cultural Context**

Wisdom Literature reflects the cultural institution of wisdom schools, professional scribes, and intellectual tradition in ancient Israel. Archaeological evidence from Egypt and Mesopotamia confirms the existence of formal educational institutions where young men (occasionally women) trained as scribes, learning reading, writing, mathematics, legal formulas, and wisdom traditions. In Israel, wisdom instruction likely occurred in palace schools during the monarchy (training royal administrators) and temple schools during the Second Temple period (training priests and scribes). Proverbs explicitly addresses "my son," suggesting a pedagogical context where a teacher (father figure) instructs a student. The content reflects concerns of educated urbanites: proper speech, business ethics, avoiding prostitutes and loose women (concerns of young men in cities), court etiquette, and financial prudence. Cultural values emphasized include diligence versus laziness, wisdom versus folly, the fear of the Lord as foundational to knowledge, proper family relationships, and social order. Job engages profound cultural questions about theodicy (divine justice), innocent suffering, and the limits of human understanding, reflecting cultural sophistication and philosophical inquiry. Ecclesiastes displays skepticism about traditional wisdom's promises, possibly reflecting cultural crisis or the influence of Greek philosophical thought. Song of Solomon celebrates romantic love with explicit sexual imagery, contrasting with arranged marriages typical in ancient Israel, and possibly reflecting fertility themes or serving as royal wedding poetry. Social stratification evident in wisdom literature includes royalty, nobility, professionals, merchants, farmers, laborers, and the poor, with particular concern for justice toward vulnerable populations.

**Political Context**

The political context of Wisdom Literature spans from the United Monarchy through the Persian and possibly early Hellenistic periods, reflecting changing political circumstances. Proverbs' collections attributed to Solomon reflect the monarchic period when royal courts patronized wisdom traditions, similar to Egyptian and Mesopotamian royal sponsorship of learning. References to "the king" throughout Proverbs (Prov 16:10-15; 20:2, 8, 26; 25:1-7) assume monarchic government and court protocol. The superscription to Proverbs 25:1 mentions "men of Hezekiah king of Judah" copying Solomon's proverbs, indicating institutional preservation of wisdom traditions in the 8th-7th centuries BCE. Job's narrative frame assumes a patriarchal political structure without reference to Israelite monarchy or national institutions, placing it in a timeless or pre-monarchic setting. Ecclesiastes reflects possible post-monarchic political reality, with references to oppression, judicial corruption, and political instability suggesting either the late monarchic period's chaos or Persian period governance. The book's pessimism about human endeavors and political power may reflect post-exilic disillusionment after national catastrophe. Song of Solomon's references to Solomon and royal imagery reflect monarchic period traditions. The wisdom tradition generally shows less interest in nationalistic political concerns than other biblical literature, focusing instead on personal ethics, divine order, and human nature transcending specific political circumstances. This international character possibly reflects wisdom's origins in royal court schools where international diplomacy and cultural exchange occurred, requiring knowledge of broader ancient Near Eastern traditions.

**Economic Context**

Wisdom Literature reflects diverse economic contexts, from royal wealth to agricultural subsistence to commercial trade. Proverbs assumes an economic system including agriculture (vineyards, olive groves, harvests), animal husbandry, craftsmanship, trade, lending and borrowing, slavery, wages, and commercial transactions. Frequent warnings against surety/guaranteeing loans (Prov 6:1-5; 11:15; 17:18) and teachings about wealth, poverty, and diligence reflect a monetized economy with financial risks. The collection attributed to Solomon assumes royal wealth and international trade (reflecting 10th century BCE prosperity or idealized memory thereof). Proverbs' frequent contrast between wealth earned through righteousness versus dishonest gain reflects economic ethics within a stratified society. Job's prosperity includes vast livestock holdings (7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 oxen, 500 donkeys, Job 1:3), numerous servants, and extensive land, representing patriarchal wealth based on pastoralism and agriculture. Job's losses and restoration engage theodicy within an economic framework where prosperity indicates divine blessing—a theology Ecclesiastes and Job's dialogue question. Ecclesiastes reflects economic sophistication with references to commercial ventures, building projects, royal treasuries, taxation, and economic oppression, possibly reflecting the monetized economy of the Persian period. Song of Solomon's imagery includes luxury items (spices, perfumes, gold, silver, jewels) reflecting international trade, alongside agricultural imagery (vineyards, flocks, gardens). The wisdom tradition overall emphasizes economic diligence, prudence, generosity to the poor, and warnings against ill-gotten wealth, reflecting economic realities across Israel's history.

**Religious Context**

Wisdom Literature represents a distinctive theological perspective within the Hebrew Bible, emphasizing creation theology, natural order, divine sovereignty, and universal human experience rather than covenant history and law. Central to all wisdom texts is "the fear of the LORD," identified as the beginning or foundation of wisdom (Prov 1:7; 9:10; Job 28:28; Ps 111:10), establishing that true wisdom is fundamentally theological, grounded in proper relationship with Israel's God. However, wisdom literature employs more universal language, less frequently using Israel's covenant name "Yahweh" and more commonly using "Elohim" (God), reflecting wisdom's international character. Proverbs presents practical theology: the universe operates according to divine order; righteous living leads to blessing, wicked living to destruction; wisdom can be learned and applied. This theology of retribution assumes moral order embedded in creation. Job dramatically challenges this theology, presenting the righteous sufferer whose experience contradicts wisdom's promises, questioning divine justice while ultimately submitting to divine sovereignty beyond human comprehension. The book engages theodicy more profoundly than any other biblical text. Ecclesiastes presents skeptical wisdom, questioning whether human efforts have meaning "under the sun," concluding that joy in life's simple pleasures and fear of God constitute humanity's proper response to life's mysteries (Eccl 12:13-14). Song of Solomon presents romantic love as created good, celebrating human sexuality without explicit theological commentary, though later interpretation read it allegorically as God's love for Israel or Christ's love for the church. Wisdom literature generally lacks references to exodus, Sinai covenant, Torah, temple, or salvation history central to other biblical genres, instead grounding theology in creation and human experience, making it more accessible to international audiences and addressing universal human questions about meaning, suffering, justice, and the good life.

## Job

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Job's dating remains one of the most contested issues in biblical scholarship. The book's setting appears patriarchal (pre-Mosaic, no references to exodus, Torah, or Israelite covenant), possibly placing Job's story in the 2nd millennium BCE. The protagonist's wealth measured in livestock, his role as family priest offering sacrifices, and the archaic name "Uz" suggest antiquity. However, the book's composition date is distinct from its narrative setting. Linguistic analysis reveals features of classical Hebrew suggesting composition during the monarchic period (7th-6th centuries BCE), with some scholars proposing post-exilic authorship (5th-4th centuries BCE) based on theological sophistication and possible Persian loanwords. The book's engagement with theodicy (divine justice and innocent suffering) resonates particularly with exilic or post-exilic trauma when Israel questioned why Yahweh allowed Jerusalem's destruction despite covenant faithfulness. The text shows awareness of international wisdom traditions, particularly Mesopotamian suffering literature like "Ludlul Bel Nemeqi" (Babylonian theodicy poem) and "The Babylonian Theodicy" (acrostic dialogue about suffering), suggesting exposure to broader ancient Near Eastern intellectual traditions. Most scholars date Job's composition to the 6th-5th centuries BCE, seeing it as Israel's profound engagement with suffering theology following national catastrophe, though final redaction may have extended into the Persian period.

**Author and Audience:** Job's authorship is completely anonymous, with no internal or external attribution. Ancient Jewish tradition sometimes associated Job with Moses (Babylonian Talmud, Baba Batra 14b-15a), but this reflects speculation rather than evidence. The book's literary sophistication, poetic mastery (Job 3-41 comprises some of Hebrew's finest poetry), and philosophical depth indicate an author of exceptional education, likely associated with Israel's wisdom schools. The author demonstrates knowledge of international wisdom traditions, natural phenomena across varied geography, and complex theological arguments. The book's setting outside Israel (land of Uz, possibly Edom) with non-Israelite characters (Job, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, Zophar the Naamathite, Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite) emphasizes universal scope, addressing human suffering transcending national boundaries. The intended audience appears to be educated Israelites wrestling with theodicy—why the righteous suffer while the wicked prosper, challenging traditional wisdom's retribution theology. For post-exilic Israel, having experienced national catastrophe despite covenant faithfulness, Job's questions resonated deeply. The book doesn't provide simple answers but models honest lament, challenges inadequate theology, and ultimately affirms divine sovereignty beyond human comprehension. The audience is invited to question and struggle with God while ultimately submitting to divine mystery.

**Key Themes:** Job explores profound theological themes, primarily **theodicy and innocent suffering**: the book's central question is whether humans serve God for disinterested reasons or only for blessing (Satan's challenge, Job 1:9-11). Job's undeserved suffering challenges retribution theology—the belief that righteousness guarantees prosperity while sin causes suffering. **The inadequacy of traditional wisdom** is demonstrated through Job's three friends (Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar) who defend orthodox theology but misapply it to Job's situation, becoming "miserable comforters" (Job 16:2). Their theology isn't false but inadequate, lacking category for innocent suffering. **Human ignorance versus divine wisdom** is central: Job demands explanation from God (Job 13:3; 23:3-7), but when God answers from the whirlwind (Job 38-41), He doesn't explain Job's suffering but overwhelms Job with creation's grandeur and complexity beyond human comprehension. **Divine sovereignty** is affirmed: God owes humanity no explanation, yet graciously enters dialogue. **The limits of human knowledge** are exposed: Job's friends claim to understand God's ways, but Job recognizes mystery. **Lament as faithful response** is modeled: Job questions, complains, and challenges God, but never curses God or abandons faith. **Integrity under pressure** defines Job's character: he maintains righteousness despite loss. **The danger of religious pride** is subtly present in Elihu's speeches (Job 32-37). Ultimately, Job affirms divine sovereignty: "I know that you can do all things; no purpose of yours can be thwarted" (Job 42:2), moving from secondhand knowledge ("I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear") to personal encounter ("but now my eye sees you," Job 42:5).

**Archaeological Relevance:** Job provides limited direct archaeological correlation but reflects ancient Near Eastern wisdom traditions and cultural contexts. The **land of Uz** cannot be identified with certainty; proposals include Edom (southeast of the Dead Sea), northern Arabia, or regions east of the Jordan River. The names of Job's friends suggest Arabian or Edomite origins: Teman is associated with Edom (Jeremiah 49:7, 20; Amos 1:12), while Shuah and Buz connect to Arabian tribes (Genesis 25:2; Jeremiah 25:23). Job's wealth measured in livestock (7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 oxen, 500 donkeys, Job 1:3) reflects pastoral nomadic or semi-nomadic economy typical of the ancient Near East. The **Sabean raids** (Job 1:15) reference historically attested Arabian tribal confederations known for raids and trade. **International wisdom literature** provides important parallels: The Mesopotamian text "Ludlul Bel Nemeqi" ("I Will Praise the Lord of Wisdom") from the 2nd millennium BCE describes a righteous sufferer abandoned by gods and society, eventually restored, paralleling Job's structure. "The Babylonian Theodicy" (c. 1000 BCE) presents acrostic dialogue questioning divine justice when the wicked prosper and righteous suffer. Egyptian wisdom also engaged suffering (see "The Protests of the Eloquent Peasant"). Job's engagement with creation, meteorology, and zoology (Job 38-41) reflects ancient Near Eastern natural philosophy and cosmology. The book's legal language (Job presenting his case before God) parallels ancient Near Eastern legal procedures. Archaeological evidence for wisdom schools in Egypt and Mesopotamia (scribal training centers at Nippur, Thebes, etc.) confirms the intellectual context from which texts like Job emerged.

**Structure:** Job comprises 42 chapters organized in a complex literary structure. The book frames poetic dialogues (chapters 3-41) with prose narrative (prologue 1-2, epilogue 42:7-17), creating a sandwich structure that raises interpretive questions about the relationship between frame and dialogue. **Prologue (1-2):** Prose narrative establishes Job's righteousness, introduces the heavenly council where Satan challenges Job's motives, and describes Job's catastrophic losses (wealth, children, health) while Job maintains integrity. **Job's Lament (3):** Poetic soliloquy cursing the day of his birth, transitioning from prose to poetry. **Three Dialogue Cycles (4-27):** Job debates three friends in increasingly contentious exchanges. Each friend speaks, then Job responds. Cycle 1 (chapters 4-14): Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar speak; Job responds to each. Cycle 2 (chapters 15-21): Same pattern. Cycle 3 (chapters 22-27): Pattern breaks down as friends' arguments weaken. **Wisdom Poem (28):** Interlude reflecting on wisdom's inaccessibility to humans; only God understands. **Job's Final Defense (29-31):** Job recalls past blessing (29), laments present suffering (30), and swears oath of innocence (31), challenging God to answer. **Elihu's Speeches (32-37):** A fourth, younger participant enters, critiquing both Job and the friends, preparing for God's response. **Divine Speeches (38-41):** Yahweh answers Job from the whirlwind with rhetorical questions about creation, demonstrating divine wisdom beyond human understanding. Two speeches: first (38:1-40:2) with Job's brief response (40:3-5), second (40:6-41:34) with Job's final submission (42:1-6). **Epilogue (42:7-17):** Prose conclusion where God vindicates Job over the friends, restores double Job's wealth, blesses him with new children, and grants long life.

### Job Chapter 1

There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name
was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.
And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
And his sons went and feasted
in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
And it was so, when the days of
their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings
according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that
there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?
Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath
is
 in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
And there was a day when his sons and his daughters
were
 eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:
And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
And the Sabeans fell
upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
While he
was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
While he
was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
While he
was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters
were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:
And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,
And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.
In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.


### Job Chapter 2

Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.
And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that
there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he
is in thine hand; but save his life.
So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.
Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.
But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.
And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that
his grief was very great.


### Job Chapter 3

After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
And Job spake, and said,
Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night
in which
 it was said, There is a man child conceived.
Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.
Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
As
for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but
have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:
Because it shut not up the doors of my
mother’s womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
Why died I not from the womb?
why did I
not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;
Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:
Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants
which
 never saw light.
There the wicked cease
from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
The small and great are there; and the servant
is free from his master.
Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter
in soul;
Which long for death, but it
cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
Which rejoice exceedingly,
and are glad, when they can find the grave?
Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.


### Job Chapter 4

Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?
Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
Is not
this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
Remember, I pray thee, who
ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad.
Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,
Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image
was before mine eyes,
there was silence, and I heard a voice,
saying,
Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
How much less
in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation
is in the dust,
which are crushed before the moth?
They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding
it.
Doth not their excellency
which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.

### Job Chapter 26

*[Chapter text unavailable]*

### Job Chapter 27

Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
As God liveth,
who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty,
who hath vexed my soul;
All the while my breath
is in me, and the spirit of God
is in my nostrils;
My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach
me so long as I live.
Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
For what
is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?
Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?
I will teach you by the hand of God:
that which
is
 with the Almighty will I not conceal.
Behold, all ye yourselves have seen
it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?
This
is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors,
which they shall receive of the Almighty.
If his children be multiplied,
it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.
Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;
He may prepare
it, but the just shall put
it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth
that the keeper maketh.
The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he
is not.
Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
For
God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.
Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.


### Job Chapter 28

Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold
where
 they fine
it.
Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass
is molten
out of the stone.
He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.
The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant;
even the waters
 forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.
As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.
The stones of it
are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.
There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture’s eye hath not seen:
The lion’s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and
the thing that is
 hid bringeth he forth to light.
But where shall wisdom be found? and where
is the place of understanding?
Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.
The depth saith, It
is not in me: and the sea saith,
It is not with me.
It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed
for the price thereof.
It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it
shall not be for jewels of fine gold.
No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom
is above rubies.
The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
Whence then cometh wisdom? and where
is the place of understanding?
Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.
Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
For he looketh to the ends of the earth,
and seeth under the whole heaven;
To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:
Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that
is
 wisdom; and to depart from evil
is understanding.


### Job Chapter 29

Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
Oh that I were as
in months past, as
in the days
when God preserved me;
When his candle shined upon my head,
and when by his light I walked
through darkness;
As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God
was
 upon my tabernacle;
When the Almighty
was yet with me,
when my children
were about me;
When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
When I went out to the gate through the city,
when I prepared my seat in the street!
The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose,
and
 stood up.
The princes refrained talking, and laid
their hand on their mouth.
The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
When the ear heard
me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw
me, it gave witness to me:
Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and
him that had none to help him.
The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment
was
 as a robe and a diadem.
I was eyes to the blind, and feet
was I to the lame.
I
was a father to the poor: and the cause
which
 I knew not I searched out.
And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply
my
 days as the sand.
My root
was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.
My glory
was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
Unto me
men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.
After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide
as for the latter rain.
If I laughed on them, they believed
it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one
that comforteth the mourners.


### Job Chapter 30

But now
they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.
Yea, whereto
might the strength of their hands
profit
 me, in whom old age was perished?
For want and famine
they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots
for their meat.
They were driven forth from among
men, (they cried after them as
after a thief;)
To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys,
in caves of the earth, and
in the rocks.
Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.
They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.
And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
Upon
my right
hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
They came
upon me as a wide breaking in
of waters:
 in the desolation they rolled themselves
upon me.
Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
By the great force
of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.
I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me
not.
Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride
upon it,
 and dissolvest my substance.
For I know
that thou wilt bring me
to death, and
to the house appointed for all living.
Howbeit he will not stretch out
his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was
not my soul grieved for the poor?
When I looked for good, then evil came
unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.
I went mourning without the sun: I stood up,
and I cried in the congregation.
I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
My harp also is
turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.

### Job Chapter 31

I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
For what portion of God
is there from above? and
what
 inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange
punishment
 to the workers of iniquity?
Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.
If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or
if I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door;
Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.
For this
is an heinous crime; yea, it
is an iniquity
to be punished by the judges.
For it
is a fire
that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.
If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;
What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
If I have withheld the poor from
their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as
with a father, and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;)
If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
If his loins have not blessed me, and
if he were
not
 warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.
For destruction
from God
was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold,
Thou art my confidence;
If I rejoiced because my wealth
was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;
If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking
in
 brightness;
And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
This also
were an iniquity
to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God
that is above.
If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:
Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
The stranger did not lodge in the street:
but I opened my doors to the traveller.
If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:
Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence,
and went not out of the door?
Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire
is, that the Almighty would answer me, and
that mine adversary had written a book.
Surely I would take it upon my shoulder,
and bind it
as a crown to me.
I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.


### Job Chapter 32

So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he
was righteous in his own eyes.
Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
When Elihu saw that
there was no answer in the mouth of
these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I
am
 young, and ye
are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.
I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
But
there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
Great men are not
always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.
Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold,
there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:
Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.
Now he hath not directed
his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still,
and
 answered no more;)
I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.
For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
Behold, my belly
is as wine
which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.
I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.
Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
For I know not to give flattering titles;
in so doing my maker would soon take me away.


### Job Chapter 33

Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
My words
shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
If thou canst answer me, set
thy words in order before me, stand up.
Behold, I
am according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am formed out of the clay.
Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of
thy words,
saying,
I am clean without transgression, I
am innocent; neither
is there iniquity in me.
Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
Behold,
in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
For God speaketh once, yea twice,
yet man perceiveth it not.
In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
That he may withdraw man
from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong
pain:
So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.
His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones
that were not seen stick out.
Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:
Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:
He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.
He looketh upon men, and
if any say, I have sinned, and perverted
that which was right, and it profited me not;
He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
Lo, all these
things worketh God oftentimes with man,
To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.
If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.


### Job Chapter 34

Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
Hear my words, O ye wise
men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what
is good.
For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
Should I lie against my right? my wound
is incurable without transgression.
What man
is like Job,
who drinketh up scorning like water?
Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God,
that he should do wickedness; and
from the Almighty,
that he should commit iniquity.
For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to
his ways.
Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
If he set his heart upon man,
if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
If now
thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
Is it fit to say to a king,
Thou art wicked?
and to princes,
Ye are ungodly?
How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all
are
 the work of his hands.
In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
For his eyes
are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
For he will not lay upon man more
than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth
them
 in the night, so that they are destroyed.
He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth
his face, who then can behold him? whether
it be done
 against a nation, or against a man only:
That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne
chastisement,
 I will not offend
any more:
That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words
were without wisdom.
My desire
is that Job may be tried unto the end because of
his answers for wicked men.
For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth
his hands
 among us, and multiplieth his words against God.

## Psalms

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** The Psalms represent Israel's hymnal and prayer book, compiled over approximately 1,000 years from the monarchic period through the post-exilic era. Traditional attribution assigns 73 psalms to David (mid-10th century BCE), establishing him as the primary author and patron of temple music (2 Samuel 6:5; 1 Chronicles 15-16). However, the Psalter includes compositions from multiple periods: David's era (Psalms 3-41, 51-72), the United Monarchy under Solomon (Psalms 72, 127), the divided monarchy prophetic period (Asaph psalms 73-83, Korah psalms 42-49, 84-85, 87-88), the Babylonian exile (Psalms 74, 79, 137), and post-exilic restoration (Psalms 107, 126). Some psalms are clearly pre-exilic, celebrating the temple, kingship, and Zion theology, while others lament destruction and pray for restoration, indicating exilic composition. Post-exilic psalms reflect Second Temple worship and Torah piety. The final compilation and editing of the Psalter occurred during the Second Temple period (5th-3rd centuries BCE), organizing 150 individual psalms into five books (1-41, 42-72, 73-89, 90-106, 107-150), possibly mirroring the five books of the Torah. Superscriptions provide historical, musical, and liturgical information, though their reliability is debated. Archaeological evidence from Qumran (Dead Sea Scrolls) shows the Psalter was essentially complete by the 2nd century BCE, though psalm order varied slightly from the Masoretic Text. The Psalms functioned as Israel's worship literature throughout the Second Temple period and beyond.

**Author and Audience:** Psalms is a collection with multiple authors rather than a single-authored work. Superscriptions attribute authorship to: **David** (73 psalms, e.g., 3-9, 11-32, 34-41, 51-65, 68-70, 86, 101, 103, 108-110, 122, 124, 131, 133, 138-145), establishing him as chief psalmist. **Asaph** (12 psalms: 50, 73-83), a Levitical musician appointed by David (1 Chronicles 16:4-5). **Sons of Korah** (11 psalms: 42, 44-49, 84-85, 87-88), a Levitical guild of temple singers. **Solomon** (2 psalms: 72, 127). **Moses** (Psalm 90), connecting to the wilderness period. **Ethan the Ezrahite** (Psalm 89), a wisdom figure. **Heman the Ezrahite** (Psalm 88). Fifty psalms are anonymous. The superscriptions' historical reliability is contested, with critical scholars viewing them as later attributions reflecting tradition rather than certain authorship, while conservative scholars defend their authenticity. The variety of authors and lack of attribution for many psalms indicates compilation from various sources over centuries. The intended audience was Israel's worshiping community: originally temple personnel, priests, Levites, and pilgrims attending festivals; later synagogue congregations after the temple's destruction. Psalms functioned liturgically in public worship (thanksgiving, lament, enthronement festivals) and personally in private devotion. The five-book structure with doxologies closing each book (41:13; 72:18-19; 89:52; 106:48; 150 as a whole) suggests intentional shaping for communal use, providing resources for every aspect of relationship with God: praise, lament, confession, thanksgiving, trust, wisdom, royal celebration, and pilgrimage.

**Key Themes:** The Psalms explore comprehensive theological themes through poetry, prayer, and song. **Praise and worship** dominate, with "Hallel" (praise) appearing throughout, particularly in psalms 146-150 which climax the Psalter with pure praise. **Lament and honest emotion** characterize many psalms (e.g., 13, 22, 42-43, 88), modeling raw, honest prayer including complaint, anger, and questioning God while remaining in relationship. **Divine kingship and sovereignty** celebrate Yahweh as king over creation, nations, and history (Psalms 47, 93, 95-99). **Human kingship and messianic hope** feature in royal psalms (2, 45, 72, 89, 110) celebrating the Davidic covenant, which later Jewish and Christian traditions interpreted messianically. **Zion theology** exalts Jerusalem and the temple as God's dwelling place (Psalms 46, 48, 76, 84, 87, 122, 132). **Torah piety and wisdom** emphasize meditation on God's law and righteous living (Psalms 1, 19, 37, 119—the longest chapter in Scripture dedicated entirely to Torah). **Creation theology** praises God as creator (Psalms 8, 19, 104, 148). **Divine attributes** are explored: God's faithfulness (hesed, steadfast love), justice, mercy, holiness, omnipotence, and omniscience. **Trust in God's protection** during danger and enemies (Psalms 23, 27, 46, 91, 121). **Confession and forgiveness** (Penitential Psalms 6, 32, 38, 51, 102, 130, 143). **Thanksgiving for deliverance** (Psalms 30, 34, 40, 66, 116, 138). **Imprecatory prayers** calling for judgment on enemies (Psalms 35, 69, 109, 137), which raise ethical questions but reflect honest emotion and trust in divine justice rather than personal vengeance. **God's covenant faithfulness to Israel** throughout history (Psalms 78, 105, 106, 135, 136).

**Archaeological Relevance:** The Psalms connect to archaeological findings illuminating ancient Near Eastern worship, music, and poetry. **Musical instruments** mentioned include: lyres (kinnor), harps (nebel), tambourines (tof), cymbals (metsiltayim), trumpets (shofar, hasosrah), and flutes (halil)—many discovered archaeologically at sites throughout Israel and the ancient Near East. **Temple architecture**: Psalms of Ascent (120-134) were sung by pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem's temple, whose remains are partially visible in the Temple Mount's Western Wall and archaeological excavations. **International parallels**: Egyptian Hymn to the Aten (14th century BCE) shows striking similarities to Psalm 104's creation theology, indicating shared ancient Near Eastern poetic traditions. Ugaritic texts (14th-12th centuries BCE) from Ras Shamra use parallel poetic structures and metaphors similar to Hebrew psalms, including references to Baal as "rider of the clouds"—an epithet applied to Yahweh in Psalm 68:4. **Qumran discoveries**: The Dead Sea Scrolls preserved more Psalms manuscripts than any other biblical book (36 manuscripts), confirming the Psalter's centrality in Second Temple Judaism while showing some variation in psalm order and additional compositions (e.g., Psalm 151, canonical in some traditions). **Inscriptions**: The Ketef Hinnom silver scrolls (7th-6th centuries BCE) contain the priestly blessing from Numbers 6:24-26, demonstrating liturgical text use similar to psalmic function. **Pilgrimage routes**: Archaeological identification of ancient roads ascending to Jerusalem illuminates the Psalms of Ascent. **Ancient Near Eastern hymnody**: Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and Hittite hymns provide comparative context, showing psalms participate in international literary traditions while expressing distinctive Israelite monotheism.

**Structure:** The Psalter comprises 150 psalms organized into five books, each ending with a doxology: **Book I (Psalms 1-41)**, predominantly Davidic, ending with "Praise be to the LORD... Amen and Amen" (41:13). **Book II (Psalms 42-72)**, including Korah and Asaph psalms alongside Davidic compositions, ending with "Praise be to the LORD God... the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen" (72:18-19), and noting "This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse" (72:20). **Book III (Psalms 73-89)**, predominantly Asaph psalms, ending with exilic lament and doxology (89:52). **Book IV (Psalms 90-106)**, including Moses' psalm (90) and enthronement psalms (93, 95-99), ending with "Praise be to the LORD... Amen" (106:48). **Book V (Psalms 107-150)**, the most diverse collection including Egyptian Hallel (113-118), Songs of Ascent (120-134), and final Hallel (146-150), climaxing with Psalm 150's pure praise involving all creation. Psalms 1-2 serve as introduction, establishing Torah piety (Psalm 1) and messianic kingship (Psalm 2) as framing themes. Genre classifications include: **Hymns of praise** (8, 19, 29, 104, 148), **Laments** (individual: 3, 13, 22, 51; communal: 44, 74, 79, 80), **Thanksgiving psalms** (30, 34, 40, 116), **Royal psalms** (2, 45, 72, 110), **Enthronement psalms** (47, 93, 95-99), **Wisdom psalms** (1, 37, 73, 112, 127-128), **Penitential psalms** (6, 32, 38, 51, 102, 130, 143), **Imprecatory psalms** (35, 69, 109), **Psalms of trust** (23, 27, 46, 62, 91, 121), **Torah psalms** (1, 19, 119), and **Historical psalms** (78, 105, 106, 135-136). This diversity provides resources for every human experience and worship context.

LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.
            He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.
In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD.
He that sweareth to
his own hurt, and changeth not.
            He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these
things shall never be moved.

### Psalms Chapter 16

Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
            O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou
art
 my Lord: my goodness
extendeth not to thee;
            But to the saints that
are in the earth, and
to the excellent, in whom
is all my delight.
Their sorrows shall be multiplied
that hasten
after
 another
god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.
The LORD
is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant
places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.
I have set the LORD always before me: because
he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence
is fulness of joy; at thy right hand
there are pleasures for evermore.


### Psalms Chapter 17

Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer,
that goeth not out of feigned lips.
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.
Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited
me in the night; thou hast tried me,
and shalt find nothing; I am purposed
that my mouth shall not transgress.
Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept
me from the paths of the destroyer.
Hold up my goings in thy paths,
that my footsteps slip not.
I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me,
and hear my speech.
Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust
in thee from those that rise up
against them.Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
From the wicked that oppress me,
from my deadly enemies,
who compass me about.
They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.
They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;
Like as a lion
that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked,
which is thy sword:
From men
which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,
which have their portion in
this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid
treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their
substance to their babes.
As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.


### Psalms Chapter 18

I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
The LORD
is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation,
and my high tower.
I will call upon the LORD,
who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.
In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him,
even into his ears.
Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness
was
 under his feet.
And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him
were dark waters
and thick clouds of the skies.
At the brightness
that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail
stones and coals of fire.
The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail
stones and coals of fire.
Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.
They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
For all his judgments
were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.
For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.
For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.
For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
            As for God, his way
is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he
is a buckler to all those that trust in him.
For who
is God save the LORD? or who
is a rock save our God?
            It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.
He maketh my feet like hinds’
feet, and setteth me upon my high places.
He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.
For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.
They cried, but
there was none to save
them: even
 unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people;
and
 thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people
whom
 I have not known shall serve me.
As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.
The LORD liveth; and blessed
be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
            It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.
Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.


### Psalms Chapter 19

The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.
Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
            There is no speech nor language,
where their voice is not heard.
Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
Which
is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
and
 rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.
His going forth
is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of the LORD
is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD
is sure, making wise the simple.
The statutes of the LORD
are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD
is pure, enlightening the eyes.
The fear of the LORD
is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD
are true
and righteous altogether.
More to be desired
are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
Moreover by them is thy servant warned:
and in keeping of them
there is great reward.
Who can understand
his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
faults.Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous
sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.


### Psalms Chapter 20

The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;
Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;
Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.
Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up
our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.
Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.
Some
trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.
They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.

### Psalms Chapter 21

The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.
For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.
He asked life of thee,
and thou gavest
it him,
even length of days for ever and ever.
His glory
is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.
For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.
Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device,
which they are not able
to perform.Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back,
when thou shalt make ready
thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.
Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength:
so will we sing and praise thy power.


### Psalms Chapter 22

My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
why art thou so
 far from helping me,
and from the words of my roaring?
O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.
But thou
art holy,
O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
But I
am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.
All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head
saying,He trusted on the LORD
that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.
But thou
art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope
when I was upon my mother’s breasts.
I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou
art my God from my mother’s belly.
Be not far from me; for trouble
is near; for
there is
 none to help.
Many bulls have compassed me: strong
bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
They gaped upon me
with their mouths,
as a ravening and a roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
I may tell all my bones: they look
and stare upon me.
They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.
Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.
Save me from the lion’s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.
I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.
For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.
My praise
shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.
All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
For the kingdom
is the LORD’S: and he
is the governor among the nations.
All
they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.
A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.
They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done
this.

### Psalms Chapter 45

My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue
is the pen of a ready writer.
Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
Gird thy sword upon
thy thigh, O
most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.
And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness
and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
Thine arrows
are sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies;
whereby the people fall under thee.
Thy throne, O God,
is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom
is a right sceptre.
Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
All thy garments
smell of myrrh, and aloes,
and
 cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.
Kings’ daughters
were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house;
So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he
is thy Lord; and worship thou him.
And the daughter of Tyre
shall be there with a gift;
even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.
The king’s daughter
is all glorious within: her clothing
is of wrought gold.
She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king’s palace.
Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.
I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

### Psalms Chapter 46

God
is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
            Though the waters thereof roar
and be troubled,
though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.
            There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy
place of the tabernacles of the most High.
God
is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her,
and that right early.
The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
The LORD of hosts
is with us; the God of Jacob
is
 our refuge. Selah.
Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.
He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.
Be still, and know that I
am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
The LORD of hosts
is with us; the God of Jacob
is
 our refuge. Selah.


### Psalms Chapter 47

O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
For the LORD most high
is terrible;
he is a great King over all the earth.
He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.
He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.
Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
For God
is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.
The princes of the people are gathered together,
even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth
belong
 unto God: he is greatly exalted.


### Psalms Chapter 48

Great
is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God,
in the mountain of his holiness.
Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth,
is mount Zion,
on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.
God is known in her palaces for a refuge.
For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.
They saw
it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled,
and hasted away.
Fear took hold upon them there,
and pain, as of a woman in travail.
Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.
We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.
According to thy name, O God, so
is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.
Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.
Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.
Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell
it to the generation following.
For this God
is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide
even unto death.


### Psalms Chapter 49

Hear this, all
ye people; give ear, all
ye inhabitants of the world:
Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart
shall be of understanding.
I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,
when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
None
of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:
(For the redemption of their soul
is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)
That he should still live for ever,
and not see corruption.
For he seeth
that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
Their inward thought
is, that their houses
shall continue for ever,
and their dwelling places to all generations; they call
their lands after their own names.
Nevertheless man
being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts
that perish.
This their way
is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.
Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and
men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.
He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.
Man
that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts
that perish.


### Psalms Chapter 50

The mighty God,
even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.
Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God
is
 judge himself. Selah.
Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I
am God,
even thy God.
I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings,
to have been continually before me.
I will take no bullock out of thy house,
nor he goats out of thy folds.
For every beast of the forest
is mine,
and the cattle upon a thousand hills.
I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field
are mine.
If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world
is
 mine, and the fulness thereof.
Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:
And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or
that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?
Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.
When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.
Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.
Thou sittest
and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s son.
These
things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether
such an one as thyself:
but
 I will reprove thee, and set
them in order before thine eyes.
Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear
you in pieces, and
there be none to deliver.
Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth
his conversation
aright will I shew the salvation of God.

### Psalms Chapter 51

Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin
is ever before me.
Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done
this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest,
and
 be clear when thou judgest.
Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden
part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
Make me to hear joy and gladness;
that the bones
which
 thou hast broken may rejoice.
Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me
with thy
 free spirit.
            Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation:
and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.
For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give
it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.
The sacrifices of God
are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.


### Psalms Chapter 52

Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God
endureth
continually.
Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp rasor, working deceitfully.
Thou lovest evil more than good;
and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.
Thou lovest all devouring words, O
thou deceitful tongue.
God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of
thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.
The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:
Lo,
this is the man
that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches,
and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
But I
am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done
it: and I will wait on thy name; for
it is good before thy saints.

Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks,
unto thee do we give thanks: for
that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.
When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.
I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
Lift not up your horn on high: speak
not with a stiff neck.
For promotion
cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
But God
is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
For in the hand of the LORD
there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring
them out,
and drink
them.But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off;
but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.

### Psalms Chapter 76

In Judah
is God known: his name
is great in Israel.
In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.
There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.
Thou
art more glorious
and excellent than the mountains of prey.
The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
Thou,
even thou,
art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,
When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
He shall cut off the spirit of princes:
he is terrible to the kings of the earth.


### Psalms Chapter 77

I cried unto God with my voice,
even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.
In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth
his promise fail for evermore?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
And I said, This
is my infirmity:
but I will remember
 the years of the right hand of the most High.
I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
Thy way, O God,
is in the sanctuary: who
is so
 great a God as
our God?
Thou
art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
Thou hast with
thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.
The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.
The voice of thy thunder
was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
Thy way
is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.


### Psalms Chapter 78

Give ear, O my people,
to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
We will not hide
them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
That the generation to come might know
them, even the children
which should be born;
who should arise and declare
them to their children:
That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation
that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
The children of Ephraim,
being armed,
and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt,
in the field of Zoan.
He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave
them drink as
out of the great depths.
He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
Therefore the LORD heard
this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.
He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
And he let
it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat
was yet in their mouths,
The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen
men of Israel.
For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
And they remembered that God
was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
But he,
being full of compassion, forgave
their
 iniquity, and destroyed
them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
For he remembered that they
were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness,
and grieve him in the desert!
Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
They remembered not his hand,
nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:
And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels
among them.He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of
their
 strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary,
even to
 this mountain,
which his right hand had purchased.
He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
When God heard
this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent
which
 he placed among men;
And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.
He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep,
and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
And he built his sanctuary like high
palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.


### Psalms Chapter 79

O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given
to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and
there was none to bury
them.We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake.
Wherefore should the heathen say, Where
is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight
by the revenging of the blood of thy servants
which is shed.
Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.


### Psalms Chapter 80

Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest
between the cherubims, shine forth.
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come
and save us.
Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
Thou preparedst
room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof
were like the goodly cedars.
She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.
Why hast thou
then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch
that thou madest strong for thyself.
            It is burned with fire,
it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man
whom thou madest strong for thyself.
So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

### Psalms Chapter 81

Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
For this
was a statute for Israel,
and a law of the God of Jacob.
This he ordained in Joseph
for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt:
where I heard a language
that
 I understood not.
I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.
Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;
There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
I
am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust:
and they walked in their own counsels.
Oh that my people had hearkened unto me,
and Israel had walked in my ways!
I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.
He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.


### Psalms Chapter 82

God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
Deliver the poor and needy: rid
them out of the hand of the wicked.
They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
I have said, Ye
are gods; and all of you
are children of the most High.
But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.

O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.
Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.
Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.
He
is the LORD our God: his judgments
are in all the earth.
He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word
which he commanded to a thousand generations.
Which
covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law,
and to Israel
for an everlasting covenant:
Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:
When they were
but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.
When they went from one nation to another, from
one kingdom to another people;
He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
            Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.
He sent a man before them,
even Joseph,
who was sold for a servant:
Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.
The king sent and loosed him;
even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.
He sent Moses his servant;
and Aaron whom he had chosen.
They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies,
and lice in all their coasts.
He gave them hail for rain,
and flaming fire in their land.
He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.
He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,
And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and
there was
 not one feeble
person among their tribes.
Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.
He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.
            The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places
like a river.
For he remembered his holy promise,
and Abraham his servant.
And he brought forth his people with joy,
and his chosen with gladness:
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;
That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.

### Psalms Chapter 106

Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for
he is
 good: for his mercy
endureth for ever.
Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD?
who can shew forth all his praise?
Blessed
are they that keep judgment,
and he that doeth righteousness at all times.
Remember me, O LORD, with the favour
that thou bearest unto
 thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;
That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked
him at the sea,
even
 at the Red sea.
Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
And he saved them from the hand of him that hated
them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
They envied Moses also in the camp,
and Aaron the saint of the LORD.
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;
Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
and terrible things by the Red sea.
Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy
them.Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
But murmured in their tents,
and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.
Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
Thus they provoked
him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and
so the plague was stayed.
And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
They angered
him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
And shed innocent blood,
even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked
him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name,
and to triumph in thy praise.
Blessed
be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.


### Psalms Chapter 107

O give thanks unto the LORD, for
he is good: for his mercy
endureth for ever.
Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
and he delivered them out of their distresses.
And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
Oh that
men would praise the LORD
for his goodness, and
for his wonderful works to the children of men!
For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
being
 bound in affliction and iron;
Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:
Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and
there was none to help.
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble,
and he saved them out of their distresses.
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.
Oh that
men would praise the LORD
for his goodness, and
for his wonderful works to the children of men!
For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.
Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble,
and he saveth them out of their distresses.
He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered
them from their destructions.
Oh that
men would praise the LORD
for his goodness, and
for his wonderful works to the children of men!
And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.
They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;
These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.
They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end.
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.
He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
Oh that
men would praise the LORD
for his goodness, and
for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;
A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.
And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;
And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness,
where there is no way.
Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh
him
 families like a flock.
The righteous shall see
it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
Whoso
is wise, and will observe these
things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.


### Psalms Chapter 108

O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
Awake, psaltery and harp: I
myself will awake early.
I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
For thy mercy
is great above the heavens: and thy truth
reacheth unto the clouds.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;
That thy beloved may be delivered: save
with thy right hand, and answer me.
God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead
is mine; Manasseh
is mine; Ephraim also
is the strength of mine head; Judah
is my lawgiver;
Moab
is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.
Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
            Wilt not
thou, O God,
who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
Give us help from trouble: for vain
is the help of man.
Through God we shall do valiantly: for he
it is that shall tread down our enemies.


### Psalms Chapter 109

Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
For my love they are my adversaries: but I
give myself unto
 prayer.
And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.
When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
Let his days be few;
and let another take his office.
Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek
their bread also out of their desolate places.
Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.
Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.
Let his posterity be cut off;
and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Let it be unto him as the garment
which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
            Let this
be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.
But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name’s sake: because thy mercy
is good, deliver thou me.
For I
am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
I became also a reproach unto them:
when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.
Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
That they may know that this
is thy hand;
that
 thou, LORD, hast done it.
Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save
him
 from those that condemn his soul.


### Psalms Chapter 110

The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
Thy people
shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.
The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou
art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill
the places
 with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.
He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.

### Psalms Chapter 111

Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with
my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and
in the congregation.
The works of the LORD
are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
His work
is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD
is
 gracious and full of compassion.
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.
He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
The works of his hands
are verity and judgment; all his commandments
are sure.
They stand fast for ever and ever,
and are done in truth and uprightness.
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend
is his name.
The fear of the LORD
is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do
his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.


### Psalms Chapter 112

Praise ye the LORD. Blessed
is the man
that feareth the LORD,
that delighteth greatly in his commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
Wealth and riches
shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness:
he is
 gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.
A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.
Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.
His heart
is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see
his desire upon his enemies.
He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
The wicked shall see
it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.

Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise
him,
 O ye servants of the LORD.
Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God,
Praise the LORD; for the LORD
is good: sing praises unto his name; for
it is pleasant.
For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself,
and Israel for his peculiar treasure.
For I know that the LORD
is great, and
that our Lord
is above all gods.
Whatsoever the LORD pleased,
that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.
He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.
Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
            Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:
And gave their land
for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.
Thy name, O LORD,
endureth for ever;
and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.
For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.
The idols of the heathen
are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.
They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there
any breath in their mouths.
They that make them are like unto them:
so is every one that trusteth in them.
Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:
Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.
Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

 for ever.


### Psalms Chapter 137

By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us
required of us mirth,
saying, Sing us
one of the songs of Zion.
How shall we sing the LORD’S song in a strange land?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget
her cunning.If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.
Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase
it, rase
it, even to the foundation thereof.
O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy
shall he be,
 that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
Happy
shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.


### Psalms Chapter 138

I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
In the day when I cried thou answeredst me,
and strengthenedst me
with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great
is
 the glory of the LORD.
Though the LORD
be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.
The LORD will perfect
that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD,
endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.


### Psalms Chapter 139

O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known
me.Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted
with
 all my ways.
For
there is not a word in my tongue,
but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.
            Such knowledge
is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot
attain unto it.
Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
If I ascend up into heaven, thou
art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou
art there.            If I take the wings of the morning,
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.
Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light
are both alike
to thee.
For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb.
I will praise thee; for I am fearfully
and wonderfully made: marvellous
are thy works; and
that my soul knoweth right well.
My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret,
and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all
my members were written,
which in continuance were fashioned, when
as yet there was none of them.
How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!
            If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.
Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
For they speak against thee wickedly,
and thine enemies take
thy name in vain.
Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
And see if
there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.


### Psalms Chapter 140

Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;
Which imagine mischiefs in
their heart; continually are they gathered together
for war.
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders’ poison
is under their lips. Selah.
Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.
The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.
I said unto the LORD, Thou
art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.
O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device;
lest they exalt themselves. Selah.
            As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow
him.I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
and the right of the poor.
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.

### Psalms Chapter 141

LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
Let my prayer be set forth before thee
as incense;
and
 the lifting up of my hands
as the evening sacrifice.
Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
Incline not my heart to
any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.
Let the righteous smite me;
it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me;
it shall be an excellent oil,
which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also
shall be in their calamities.
When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
Our bones are scattered at the grave’s mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth
wood upon the earth.
But mine eyes
are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
Keep me from the snares
which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.


### Psalms Chapter 142

I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.
I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
I looked on
my right hand, and beheld, but
there was
 no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.
I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou
art my refuge
and my portion in the land of the living.
Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.

## Proverbs

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Proverbs is a collection compiled over several centuries, with material spanning from the early monarchy (10th century BCE) through the post-exilic period (5th-4th centuries BCE). The book explicitly identifies multiple historical layers: "The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel" (1:1) attributes the core collection to Solomon's era (c. 970-930 BCE). Solomon's reputation for wisdom (1 Kings 3:16-28; 4:29-34) and international cultural exchange established him as Israel's quintessential sage, though whether he personally authored these proverbs or patronized their collection remains debated. Proverbs 25:1 notes "These are more proverbs of Solomon, copied by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah," indicating editorial activity during Hezekiah's reign (late 8th century BCE), a period of literary renaissance and reform. Additional collections attribute material to "the wise" (22:17; 24:23), "Agur son of Jakeh" (30:1), and "King Lemuel" (31:1)—figures whose identity and dating remain uncertain but suggest non-Israelite or international sources, reflecting wisdom's cosmopolitan character. The striking parallels between Proverbs 22:17-24:22 and the Egyptian "Instruction of Amenemope" (dated 13th-11th centuries BCE) indicate international wisdom exchange during the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. Most scholars view Proverbs' final redaction occurring during the post-exilic period (5th-4th centuries BCE) when scribes compiled and organized earlier collections into the current 31-chapter form, creating a wisdom textbook for Second Temple Judaism.

**Author and Audience:** Proverbs credits multiple authors, reflecting its composite nature. **Solomon** receives primary attribution (1:1; 10:1; 25:1), based on his legendary wisdom, extensive proverbs (1 Kings 4:32 claims 3,000 proverbs), and royal court patronage of learning. However, Solomonic attribution may represent honorific association (like attributing psalms to David or law to Moses) rather than literal authorship. Critical scholarship sees much material as post-Solomonic, compiled by wisdom schools over centuries. **The Wise** are credited in 22:17 and 24:23, referring to professional sages or teachers in Israel's educational institutions. **Agur son of Jakeh** (30:1) and **King Lemuel** (31:1) represent unknown figures, possibly non-Israelite, emphasizing wisdom's international scope. Lemuel's teaching from "his mother" (31:1) is unusual, acknowledging women's role in wisdom transmission. The **men of Hezekiah** (25:1) served as royal scribes and editors during Judah's literary flourishing. The intended audience was primarily young men being educated for administrative, commercial, or religious leadership roles. The repeated address "my son" (1:8, 10; 2:1; 3:1, etc.) reflects the pedagogical context of wisdom schools where teachers instructed students. Content addresses concerns of urban, educated males: avoiding prostitutes and adulteresses (2:16-19; 5:1-23; 6:20-35; 7:1-27), proper speech and conduct in royal courts (16:10-15; 25:2-7), business ethics, financial prudence, and social relationships. However, Proverbs concludes with the "woman of noble character" poem (31:10-31), celebrating feminine wisdom and virtue. The broader audience included all Israelites seeking to live skillfully and righteously, making wisdom accessible beyond elite education.

**Key Themes:** Proverbs develops practical theology through pithy sayings teaching the art of living well. **The fear of the LORD** is the foundational theme, declared as "the beginning of knowledge" (1:7) and "the beginning of wisdom" (9:10), establishing that true wisdom is fundamentally theological, grounded in reverent relationship with Yahweh. **Wisdom versus folly** provides the central contrast: wisdom leads to life, prosperity, and honor; folly leads to destruction, poverty, and shame. Wisdom is personified as a woman calling people to understanding (1:20-33; 8:1-36; 9:1-6), while folly is also personified as a seductive adulteress leading to death (7:6-27; 9:13-18). **Retribution theology** dominates: righteous actions produce good consequences; wicked actions bring bad consequences. This moral order is embedded in creation, not merely imposed externally. However, Proverbs acknowledges exceptions (occasional prosperity of the wicked, suffering of the righteous) without fully resolving the tension—something Job and Ecclesiastes will explore more deeply. **Practical ethics** address speech (power of tongue, honest vs. deceptive words), work (diligence vs. laziness), wealth (proper and improper acquisition, generosity vs. greed), family (honor parents, discipline children, faithful marriage), friendship (choosing companions, loyalty), justice (fair dealings, concern for the poor), and self-control (anger, appetites, sexual purity). **Parental instruction** emphasizes training children in wisdom (22:6). **The power of words** is repeatedly stressed—speech can heal or harm, build up or destroy. **Social responsibility** includes concern for the poor and vulnerable (14:31; 19:17; 21:13; 22:22-23), fair business practices, and honest governance. **The personification of Wisdom** in chapters 1-9 presents Wisdom as existing before creation, participating in God's creative work (8:22-31), inviting people to feast at her table (9:1-6), and offering life to those who embrace her.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Proverbs reflects and parallels international wisdom traditions documented archaeologically throughout the ancient Near East. The most significant parallel is **The Instruction of Amenemope**, an Egyptian wisdom text from the Ramesside period (13th-11th centuries BCE), showing striking similarities to Proverbs 22:17-24:22 in structure, vocabulary, and content. This demonstrates cultural exchange between Israel and Egypt during the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. Other **Egyptian instruction texts** include: The Instruction of Ptahhotep (Old Kingdom, c. 2400 BCE), Teaching of Ani (New Kingdom, c. 1300 BCE), and Instruction of Ankhsheshonq (Ptolemaic period), all addressing similar themes of wisdom, proper conduct, speech, and social relationships. **Mesopotamian wisdom** includes: The Instructions of Shuruppak (Sumerian, 3rd millennium BCE), Akkadian proverb collections from various periods, and the Counsels of Wisdom. **Sumerian proverb collections** discovered at Nippur and other sites contain sayings parallel in form and content to biblical proverbs. Archaeological evidence confirms **scribal schools** in Egypt and Mesopotamia where young men trained as administrators, learning reading, writing, mathematics, and wisdom literature—providing the institutional context for books like Proverbs. **Israelite inscriptions** like the Gezer Calendar, Siloam Inscription, and various ostraca demonstrate widespread literacy among administrative classes in monarchic Judah and Israel, supporting the existence of similar educational institutions. The **30 sayings** structure mentioned in Proverbs 22:20 ("Have I not written thirty sayings") parallels the thirty chapters in Amenemope, confirming literary borrowing or shared traditions. These parallels don't diminish Proverbs' uniqueness but situate it within international wisdom while emphasizing distinctive Israelite theology centered on Yahweh-fear.

**Structure:** Proverbs contains 31 chapters organized into distinct collections with different literary styles and editorial frameworks. **Prologue (1:1-7):** Introduces the book's purpose, audience, and foundational principle ("The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge"). **Part I: Wisdom's Instructions (1:8-9:18):** Extended discourses from father to son, featuring personified Wisdom calling people to understanding and contrasting wisdom with folly. Includes warnings against sinful enticements, adultery, and foolishness, while celebrating Wisdom's role in creation. This section uses longer pedagogical speeches rather than short proverbs. **Part II: Proverbs of Solomon (10:1-22:16):** 375 individual proverbs, predominantly two-line sayings using antithetical parallelism (contrasting righteous and wicked, wise and foolish). Attributes to Solomon. No apparent topical organization; sayings seem randomly arranged, requiring readers to discern patterns and applications. **Part III: Sayings of the Wise (22:17-24:22):** Thirty sayings (22:20) closely paralleling Egyptian Instruction of Amenemope, using instruction format ("Do not..." commands). Focuses on social justice, proper conduct, and avoiding wickedness. **Part IV: Additional Sayings of the Wise (24:23-34):** Brief collection emphasizing justice, diligence, and honest testimony. **Part V: More Proverbs of Solomon (25:1-29:27):** Second major Solomonic collection, copied by Hezekiah's scribes. Includes extended comparison proverbs, royal sayings, and practical wisdom. Shows more topical grouping than chapters 10-22. **Part VI: Sayings of Agur (30:1-33):** Numerical sayings ("three things... four") and observations about the natural world and human behavior. **Part VII: Sayings of King Lemuel (31:1-9):** Instructions from Lemuel's mother about kingship, justice, and avoiding vice. **Epilogue: The Woman of Noble Character (31:10-31):** Acrostic poem (each verse begins with successive Hebrew alphabet letters) celebrating the virtuous woman, personifying wisdom in practical form and concluding the book by demonstrating that true wisdom is embodied, not merely theoretical.

### Proverbs Chapter 15

A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.
The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.
The eyes of the LORD
are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.
A wholesome tongue
is a tree of life: but perverseness therein
is a breach in the spirit.
A fool despiseth his father’s instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.
In the house of the righteous
is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.
The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish
doeth not so.
The sacrifice of the wicked
is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright
is his delight.
The way of the wicked
is an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.
Correction
is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way:
and he that hateth reproof shall die.
Hell and destruction
are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?
A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.
A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.
The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.
All the days of the afflicted
are evil: but he that is of a merry heart
hath a continual feast.
Better
is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.
Better
is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.
A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but
he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.
The way of the slothful
man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous
is made plain.
A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.
Folly
is joy to
him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.
Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.
A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word
spoken
 in due season, how good
is it!
The way of life
is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.
The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow.
The thoughts of the wicked
are an abomination to the LORD: but
the words of the pure
are pleasant words.
He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.
The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.
The LORD
is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.
The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart:
and a good report maketh the bones fat.
The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.
He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.
The fear of the LORD
is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour
is humility.

### Proverbs Chapter 16

The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue,
is from the LORD.
All the ways of a man
are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.
Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.
The LORD hath made all
things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.
Every one
that is proud in heart
is an abomination to the LORD:
though hand
join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.
By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD
men depart from evil.
When a man’s ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.
Better
is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.
A man’s heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.
A divine sentence
is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.
A just weight and balance
are the LORD’S: all the weights of the bag
are his work.
It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.
Righteous lips
are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.
The wrath of a king
is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.
In the light of the king’s countenance
is life; and his favour
is as a cloud of the latter rain.
How much better
is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!
The highway of the upright
is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.
Pride
goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.
Better
it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.
He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy
is he.
The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.
Understanding
is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools
is folly.
The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.
Pleasant words
are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof
are the ways of death.
He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.
An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips
there is
 as a burning fire.
A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.
A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way
that is not good.
He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.
The hoary head
is a crown of glory,
if it be found in the way of righteousness.
He that is slow to anger
is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof
is of the LORD.


### Proverbs Chapter 17

Better
is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices
with strife.
A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.
The fining pot
is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.
A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips;
and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.
Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker:
and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.
Children’s children
are the crown of old men; and the glory of children
are their fathers.
Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.
A gift
is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth
very friends.
A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.
An evil
man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.
Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.
The beginning of strife
is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.
He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both
are abomination to the LORD.
Wherefore
is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing
he hath no heart
to it?
A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.
A man void of understanding striketh hands,
and becometh surety in the presence of his friend.
He loveth transgression that loveth strife:
and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.
He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.
He that begetteth a fool
doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.
A merry heart doeth good
like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.
A wicked
man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.
Wisdom
is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool
are in the ends of the earth.
A foolish son
is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.
Also to punish the just
is not good,
nor to strike princes for equity.
He that hath knowledge spareth his words:
and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.
Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise:
and
 he that shutteth his lips
is esteemed a man of understanding.


### Proverbs Chapter 18

Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh
and
 intermeddleth with all wisdom.
A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.
When the wicked cometh,
then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.
The words of a man’s mouth
are as deep waters,
and
 the wellspring of wisdom
as a flowing brook.
It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.
A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.
A fool’s mouth
is his destruction, and his lips
are
 the snare of his soul.
The words of a talebearer
are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.
The name of the LORD
is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.
The rich man’s wealth
is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.
Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour
is humility.
He that answereth a matter before he heareth
it, it
is folly and shame unto him.
The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?
The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.
He that is first in his own cause
seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.
The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.
A brother offended
is harder to be won than a strong city: and
their contentions
are like the bars of a castle.
A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;
and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.
Death and life
are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good
thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.
The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.
A man
that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend
that sticketh closer than a brother.


### Proverbs Chapter 19

Better
is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than
he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.
Also,
that the soul
be without knowledge,
it is
 not good; and he that hasteth with
his feet sinneth.
The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.
Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.
A false witness shall not be unpunished, and
he that speaketh lies shall not escape.
Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man
is
 a friend to him that giveth gifts.
All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth
them with words,
yet they
are wanting
to him.
He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul:
he that keepeth understanding shall find good.
A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.
Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.
The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and
it is his glory to pass over a transgression.
The king’s wrath
is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour
is as dew upon the grass.
A foolish son
is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife
are a continual dropping.
House and riches
are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife
is from the LORD.
Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.
He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul;
but
 he that despiseth his ways shall die.
He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.
Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.
A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver
him, yet thou must do it again.
Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.
There are many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.
The desire of a man
is his kindness: and a poor man
is better than a liar.
The fear of the LORD
tendeth to life: and
he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.
A slothful
man hideth his hand in
his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding,
and he will understand knowledge.
He that wasteth
his father,
and chaseth away
his mother,
is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.
Cease, my son, to hear the instruction
that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.
An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.
Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.


### Proverbs Chapter 20

Wine
is a mocker, strong drink
is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.
The fear of a king
is as the roaring of a lion:
whoso
 provoketh him to anger sinneth
against his own soul.
It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.
The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold;
therefore
 shall he beg in harvest, and
have nothing.
Counsel in the heart of man
is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.
Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?
The just
man walketh in his integrity: his children
are
 blessed after him.
A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.
Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?
Divers weights,
and divers measures, both of them
are
 alike abomination to the LORD.
Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work
be
 pure, and whether
it be right.
The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.
Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes,
and
 thou shalt be satisfied with bread.
It is naught,
it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.
There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge
are a precious jewel.
Take his garment that is surety
for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
Bread of deceit
is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.
He that goeth about
as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.
Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.
An inheritance
may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.
Say not thou, I will recompense evil;
but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.
Divers weights
are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance
is not good.
Man’s goings
are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?
It is a snare to the man
who devoureth
that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry.
A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.
The spirit of man
is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.
Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.
The glory of young men
is their strength: and the beauty of old men
is the grey head.
The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so
do stripes the inward parts of the belly.

### Proverbs Chapter 21

The king’s heart
is in the hand of the LORD,
as
 the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.
Every way of a man
is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.
To do justice and judgment
is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.
An high look, and a proud heart,
and the plowing of the wicked,
is sin.
The thoughts of the diligent
tend only to plenteousness; but of every one
that is hasty only to want.
The getting of treasures by a lying tongue
is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.
The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.
The way of man
is froward and strange: but
as for
 the pure, his work
is right.
It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.
The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.
When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.
The righteous
man wisely considereth the house of the wicked:
but God overthroweth the wicked for
their wickedness.
Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.
A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.
It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction
shall be to the workers of iniquity.
The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.
He that loveth pleasure
shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.
The wicked
shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.
It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.
There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.
He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.
A wise
man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.
Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.
Proud
and haughty scorner
is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.
The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.
He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.
The sacrifice of the wicked
is abomination: how much more,
when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?
A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.
A wicked man hardeneth his face: but
as for the upright, he directeth his way.
There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.
The horse
is prepared against the day of battle: but safety
is of the LORD.


### Proverbs Chapter 22

A
good name
is rather to be chosen than great riches,
and loving favour rather than silver and gold.
The rich and poor meet together: the LORD
is the maker of them all.
A prudent
man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.
By humility
and the fear of the LORD
are riches, and honour, and life.
Thorns
and snares
are in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.
Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.
The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower
is servant to the lender.
He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.
He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor.
Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.
He that loveth pureness of heart,
for the grace of his lips the king
shall be his friend.
The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.
The slothful
man saith,
There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.
The mouth of strange women
is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.
Foolishness
is bound in the heart of a child;
but
 the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.
He that oppresseth the poor to increase his
riches, and he that giveth to the rich,
shall surely
come to want.
Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.
For
it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.
That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.
Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,
That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?
Rob not the poor, because he
is poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:
For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.
Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:
Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.
Be not thou
one of them that strike hands,
or of them that are sureties for debts.
If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?
Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.
Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean
men.

## Ecclesiastes

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Ecclesiastes (Hebrew: Qoheleth, "the Teacher" or "the Assembler") presents one of the Bible's most challenging dating questions. The book claims Solomonic authorship through its opening identification as "the words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem" (1:1) and references to unparalleled wisdom, building projects, and wealth (1:12-2:11) matching Solomon's reputation. However, virtually all modern scholars date Ecclesiastes to the Persian or early Hellenistic period (4th-3rd centuries BCE), making it one of the latest Old Testament books. Evidence includes: **Linguistic features**: Late Biblical Hebrew with numerous Aramaisms, Persian loanwords (pardes/"garden" in 2:5), and possibly Greek influence, characteristic of post-exilic Hebrew. **Historical references**: The book's political pessimism, critique of royal power (8:2-9; 10:16-17, 20), and observations about oppression (4:1-3) fit post-monarchic reality better than Solomon's prosperous reign. **Theological development**: The book's skepticism, questioning of traditional wisdom's retribution theology, and emerging proto-existential philosophy suggest mature theological reflection uncommon in the monarchic period. **Cultural context**: Awareness of fate and chance (9:11-12), engagement with philosophical questions about meaning and mortality, and possible interaction with Greek philosophical thought (though debated) suggest Hellenistic influence. Most scholars date composition to approximately 450-250 BCE, with many favoring the 3rd century BCE. Solomonic attribution likely served as literary device (pseudepigraphy) lending authority to provocative teachings, or represented attribution to the wisdom tradition Solomon epitomized.

**Author and Audience:** The author identifies as "Qoheleth" (Hebrew: קֹהֶלֶת), traditionally translated "Preacher" or "Teacher," possibly meaning "one who convenes an assembly" or "collector of sayings." The name appears seven times in Ecclesiastes but nowhere else in Scripture. The book's epilogue (12:9-14), written in third person, describes Qoheleth as a sage who "taught the people knowledge" and "pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs" (12:9), suggesting he was a professional wisdom teacher. The author adopts a Solomonic persona, referencing royal wealth, wisdom, and building projects (chapters 1-2), but this appears to be literary fiction rather than literal authorship. The real author was likely a learned Jewish sage in Jerusalem during the Persian or Hellenistic period, well-versed in international wisdom traditions, deeply philosophical, and willing to question conventional theology. His skeptical questioning of traditional wisdom's promises, combined with orthodox affirmations (12:13-14), may indicate intentional provocation within acceptable boundaries or editorial framing of controversial content. The intended audience was educated Jews wrestling with life's apparent meaninglessness, the failure of retribution theology to explain experience, and questions about divine justice. The book addresses post-exilic disillusionment following the failure of prophetic expectations: the Davidic kingdom was not restored, the nations did not stream to Zion, and righteous living did not guarantee prosperity. Qoheleth speaks to those whose experience contradicts traditional theology, offering honest acknowledgment of life's enigmas while ultimately affirming fear of God despite mystery.

**Key Themes:** Ecclesiastes explores profound existential and theological questions through recurring refrains and observations. **Hebel ("vanity" or "meaninglessness")** is the book's signature word, appearing 38 times, declaring "Meaningless! Meaningless! Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless" (1:2). The Hebrew hebel literally means "breath" or "vapor," suggesting transience, futility, and inscrutability. Qoheleth applies this to human endeavors, wisdom, pleasure, toil, wealth, and life itself. **Life "under the sun"** (used 29 times) frames the perspective as earthly, horizontal, and empirical—what can be observed without special revelation. **The inscrutable nature of God's work**: "He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end" (3:11). Humans cannot discern divine purposes or predict outcomes. **Critique of retribution theology**: Unlike Proverbs' promise that righteousness leads to blessing and wickedness to destruction, Ecclesiastes observes that "the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God's hands, but no one knows whether love or hate awaits them" (9:1). Good people die young, the wicked prosper, oppression continues—contradicting simple moral causality. **The universality of death**: Rich and poor, wise and fool, righteous and wicked all die, and death erases earthly distinctions (2:14-16; 3:19-20; 9:2-3). **Joy in the present**: Amid life's hebel, Qoheleth advocates enjoying simple pleasures as God's gift—eating, drinking, work, companionship (2:24-25; 3:12-13, 22; 5:18-19; 8:15; 9:7-9). **The limits of wisdom**: While superior to folly, wisdom cannot solve life's mysteries or prevent death (2:12-16; 8:16-17). **Fear God**: Despite skepticism, the book concludes orthodoxly: "Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind" (12:13).

**Archaeological Relevance:** Ecclesiastes provides limited direct archaeological correlation but reflects cultural and intellectual contexts illuminated by ancient evidence. **Persian period Yehud**: Archaeological evidence from 5th-4th century BCE Judah (stamped jar handles marked "Yehud," Elephantine papyri, Persian administrative documents) shows Jews living under foreign imperial rule with limited autonomy, matching Ecclesiastes' political pessimism and observations about oppressive governance. The book's warnings about hasty vows in "God's house" (5:1-7) and references to temple worship (4:17-5:7) fit Second Temple Judaism. **Hellenistic influence**: If dated to the 3rd century BCE, Ecclesiastes may reflect early Hellenistic philosophical impact, particularly Epicurean emphasis on enjoying present pleasures and Stoic acceptance of fate, though direct dependence is debated. Some scholars see parallels with Greek philosophy's questioning of meaning, mortality, and happiness. **International wisdom**: Mesopotamian and Egyptian wisdom literature engage similar themes: The Babylonian "Dialogue of Pessimism" presents a servant agreeing with his master's contradictory plans, concluding life is meaningless. The "Gilgamesh Epic" confronts human mortality and the futility of seeking immortality. Egyptian "Harper's Songs" advocate enjoying life before death's inevitability. These parallels show Ecclesiastes participates in international intellectual discourse. **Economic references**: Mentions of commerce, agricultural labor, oppression, and economic inequality reflect the monetized economy of the Persian/Hellenistic periods. **Linguistic evidence**: Late Hebrew features, Aramaisms, and possible Persian loanwords (pardes, 2:5) situate composition in the post-exilic period when Aramaic influenced Hebrew and Persian administration governed Judah.

**Structure:** Ecclesiastes comprises 12 chapters with a frame narrative (1:1-11; 12:9-14) surrounding Qoheleth's observations and reflections (1:12-12:8). **Prologue (1:1-11):** Introduces Qoheleth and states the thesis: "Meaningless! Everything is meaningless!" Establishes the cyclical, repetitive nature of existence. **Royal Experiment (1:12-2:26):** Qoheleth adopts Solomonic persona, testing whether wisdom, pleasure, building projects, or wealth provide meaning. Conclusion: all is hebel, "chasing after the wind." Yet enjoyment of work is God's gift. **Observations on Time and Toil (3:1-4:16):** Famous poem "There is a time for everything" (3:1-8) followed by reflections on God's inscrutable timing, death's universality, oppression's tragedy, and the value of companionship. **Reflections on Worship, Wealth, and Wisdom (5:1-7:29):** Warnings about rash religious vows, observations that wealth doesn't satisfy, and comparative evaluations of wisdom, sorrow, and human nature. **Life Under Oppression (8:1-9:12):** Navigating unjust authority, the mystery of divine judgment delayed, death's universal shadow, and the role of time and chance. **Practical Wisdom and Carpe Diem (9:13-11:6):** Despite life's uncertainties, act wisely, work diligently, and take reasonable risks because inaction guarantees nothing. **Poem on Youth and Aging (11:7-12:8):** Exhortation to enjoy youth before old age's decline (described through extended metaphor in 12:1-7) and death's arrival: "Remember your Creator in the days of your youth." Climaxes with "Meaningless! Everything is meaningless!" **Epilogue (12:9-14):** Third-person conclusion commending Qoheleth's wisdom, warning against endless study, and providing orthodox framework: "Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind. For God will bring every deed into judgment." The structure alternates between pessimistic observations and positive exhortations to enjoy life, creating tension between skepticism and faith ultimately resolved (or framed) by the epilogue's traditional piety.

## Song of Solomon

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Song of Solomon (also called Song of Songs or Canticles) presents significant dating challenges, with proposals ranging from the 10th century BCE (Solomonic era) to the post-exilic period (5th-4th centuries BCE). The superscription "Solomon's Song of Songs" (1:1) traditionally attributed the book to King Solomon (c. 970-930 BCE), consistent with his reputation for composing songs (1 Kings 4:32 credits him with 1,005 songs). The book references Solomon six times (1:1, 5; 3:7, 9, 11; 8:11-12) and includes royal imagery fitting the monarchic period. Linguistic analysis reveals classical Hebrew poetry without clear late linguistic features, permitting early dating. The flora and fauna mentioned (cedar, henna, vines, gazelles, doves) suit Palestine's natural environment across multiple periods. However, scholars debate authorship and date based on: **Linguistic features**: Some Persian loanwords (pardes/"orchard" in 4:13, identical to Ecclesiastes 2:5) suggest post-exilic influence. **Literary genre**: The book's dramatic dialogue structure and romantic celebration may reflect Hellenistic literary forms if dated late. **Geographical references**: Mentions of locations throughout Israel (Jerusalem, En-gedi, Carmel, Lebanon, Tirzah, Gilead) might indicate unified monarchy awareness or later literary compilation. Conservative scholars favor Solomonic authorship (10th century BCE), moderate scholars propose composition during the divided monarchy (8th-7th centuries BCE), and critical scholars often prefer post-exilic dating (5th-4th centuries BCE). The book's lack of explicit historical references, timeless subject matter, and poetic character make definitive dating difficult. Most scholars acknowledge ancient poetic traditions underlying the text, possibly compiled or edited into final form during the post-exilic period.

**Author and Audience:** Traditional attribution assigns authorship to King Solomon based on the superscription "The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's" (1:1). The grammatical construction could mean "by Solomon," "for Solomon," "about Solomon," or "in the tradition of Solomon," leaving authorship ambiguous. Solomon's connection to the book appears in references to his wedding procession (3:7-11), his vineyards (8:11-12), and use of his name by the female beloved (1:5; 3:7, 9). Ancient Jewish and Christian tradition accepted Solomonic authorship. However, modern scholarship questions this attribution, noting that: (1) the grammatical form of the superscription doesn't require personal authorship, (2) Solomon appears as a character within the poems (3:7-11) speaking in third person, and (3) the female voice dominates the book, making male authorship less certain. Some scholars propose female authorship or compilation of women's love poetry given the strong feminine perspective. The dialogue structure suggests multiple voices: the female beloved (Shulammite), male lover, and possibly Jerusalem's "daughters" as chorus. Authorship may be collective, anthologizing ancient Israelite love poetry from various sources, similar to how Psalms and Proverbs compiled material. The intended audience was likely ancient Israel's community, though the purpose remains debated: Was it wedding liturgy? Celebration of human sexuality within marriage? Allegory of God's love for Israel? Regardless of original intent, Jewish tradition read it allegorically as Yahweh's love for Israel, while Christian interpretation saw Christ's love for the Church, reflecting the book's canonical function across centuries.

**Key Themes:** Song of Solomon celebrates themes unique within Scripture. **Romantic love and desire**: The book portrays mutual romantic and sexual love between man and woman with explicit sensuality unprecedented in biblical literature. The lovers describe each other's physical beauty in elaborate wasf (descriptive poem) form, using metaphorical imagery drawn from nature and architecture (4:1-7; 5:10-16; 6:4-7; 7:1-9). **Female voice and agency**: The woman speaks more than the man, expressing desire, initiating encounters, and celebrating sexuality, providing rare biblical female perspective. She declares "I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine" (6:3), emphasizing mutuality. **Physical beauty and pleasure**: Unlike much religious literature emphasizing spirit over flesh, Song of Solomon celebrates physical beauty, sensory pleasure (taste, smell, sight, touch), gardens, vineyards, spices, and wine as goods enjoyed without guilt. **Fidelity and exclusivity**: Despite passionate sexuality, the relationship is monogamous and exclusive. "Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death" (8:6) declares love's permanent claim. **Love's power**: "Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If one were to give all the wealth of one's house for love, it would be utterly scorned" (8:7) affirms love transcends material values. **Rural Palestinian setting**: Imagery draws from agriculture, shepherding, vineyards, and natural landscapes, grounding love in creation's goodness. **The search motif**: The woman repeatedly seeks her beloved through Jerusalem's streets (3:1-4; 5:6-8), creating narrative tension and longing. **Social barriers**: References to watchmen beating the woman (5:7), her brothers' anger (1:6; 8:8-9), and societal disapproval suggest love faces external obstacles.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Song of Solomon's poetic imagery and cultural references connect to archaeological evidence of ancient Near Eastern life. **Ancient love poetry**: Egyptian love poetry from the New Kingdom period (13th-11th centuries BCE) shows striking parallels to Song of Solomon in imagery, structure, and themes. The Chester Beatty and Harris Papyri contain love poems using similar metaphors (lovers as gardens, gazelles, doves), demonstrating shared ancient Near Eastern conventions. Mesopotamian sacred marriage texts (Sumerian and Akkadian) celebrating divine couples (Inanna and Dumuzi, Ishtar and Tammuz) parallel Song of Solomon's imagery, though the biblical book lacks explicit divine identification. **Flora and fauna**: The book mentions numerous plants and animals: cedars of Lebanon, henna from En-gedi, pomegranates, mandrakes (fertility associations), gazelles, doves, foxes, and lions—all native to ancient Palestine and documented archaeologically. **Geographical locations**: Places mentioned include Jerusalem, En-gedi (oasis west of Dead Sea), Carmel (coastal mountain), Sharon (coastal plain), Lebanon (northern mountains), Tirzah (northern Israelite capital before Samaria), and Baal-hamon (location unknown)—real locations reflecting Palestine's geography. **Royal imagery**: References to Solomon's wedding carriage, crown, and palanquin (3:7-11) reflect monarchic period royal culture. **Viniculture and perfumes**: The book's references to vineyards, wine, perfumes (myrrh, frankincense, spikenard), and spices reflect ancient Near Eastern luxury trade documented archaeologically in warehouse remains, trade routes, and inscriptions mentioning luxury goods. **Urban architecture**: Descriptions of towers, walls, gates, and streets (5:7; 7:4; 8:9-10) reflect ancient Israelite city planning visible in archaeological remains. **Seals**: The metaphor "Place me like a seal over your heart" (8:6) references cylinder and stamp seals used for identification and ownership, thousands of which have been discovered archaeologically throughout the ancient Near East.

**Structure:** Song of Solomon comprises 8 chapters of lyric poetry organized as dramatic dialogue between lovers, though lacking clear narrative plot. Structure is debated; proposals include: **Anthology model**: Collection of independent love poems without unified structure, perhaps used in wedding celebrations. **Dramatic model**: Unified drama with characters (beloved woman, lover, possibly Solomon as rival or symbolic figure, daughters of Jerusalem as chorus) and loose plot (courtship, separation, reunion). **Liturgical model**: Wedding liturgy used over seven days of celebration. The text alternates between speakers: **The Woman (Shulammite)**: Dominant voice expressing desire, searching for beloved, describing his beauty, affirming mutual love. **The Man (Lover)**: Responds to woman, praises her beauty in elaborate wasf poems, expresses desire and devotion. **Daughters of Jerusalem**: Chorus commenting, questioning, and responding to the lovers. **Structural elements**: (1:1-2:7) introduces lovers, woman's desire, mutual admiration, and adjuration not to arouse love prematurely. (2:8-3:5) woman recalls beloved's visit and describes searching Jerusalem's streets for him. (3:6-5:1) elaborate royal wedding procession and consummation scene. (5:2-6:3) dream sequence where woman searches for absent lover, describes him to daughters. (6:4-8:4) mutual praise, affirmations of exclusive love, and increasing intimacy. (8:5-14) final poems on love's power and permanence, references to woman's brothers and Solomon's vineyard, concluding invitation. Refrains create cohesion: "Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires" (2:7; 3:5; 8:4), "I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine" (2:16; 6:3; 7:10 with variation), and the woman's searching (3:1-4; 5:6-8). The structure moves from initial attraction through obstacles to mature commitment, celebrating love's joy, power, and permanence.

### Song of Solomon Chapter 2

I
am the rose of Sharon,
and the lily of the valleys.
As the lily among thorns, so
is my love among the daughters.
As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so
is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit
was sweet to my taste.
He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me
was
 love.
Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I
am sick of love.
His left hand
is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.
I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake
my love, till he please.
The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.
My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over
and gone;
The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing
of birds
 is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;
The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines
with
 the tender grape give a
good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
O my dove,
that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret
places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet
is thy voice, and thy countenance
is
 comely.
Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines
have tender grapes.
My beloved
is mine, and I
am his: he feedeth among the lilies.
Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.


### Song of Solomon Chapter 3

By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
The watchmen that go about the city found me:
to whom I said,
 Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?
It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother’s house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.
I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake
my love, till he please.
Who
is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?
Behold his bed, which
is Solomon’s; threescore valiant men
are about it, of the valiant of Israel.
They all hold swords,
being expert in war: every man
hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.
King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.
He made the pillars thereof
of silver, the bottom thereof
of gold, the covering of it
of purple, the midst thereof being paved
with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.
Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.


### Song of Solomon Chapter 4

Behold, thou
art fair, my love; behold, thou
art
 fair; thou
hast doves’ eyes within thy locks: thy hair
is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
Thy teeth
are like a flock
of sheep that are even
 shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none
is barren among them.
Thy lips
are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech
is comely: thy temples
are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.
Thy neck
is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.
Thy two breasts
are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.
Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
Thou
art all fair, my love;
there is no spot in thee.
Come with me from Lebanon,
my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister,
my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.
How fair is thy love, my sister,
my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!
Thy lips, O
my spouse, drop
as the honeycomb: honey and milk
are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments
is like the smell of Lebanon.
A garden inclosed
is my sister,
my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
Thy plants
are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,
Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:
A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.
Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden,
that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.


### Song of Solomon Chapter 5

I am come into my garden, my sister,
my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
I sleep, but my heart waketh:
it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh,
saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew,
and my locks with the drops of the night.
I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
My beloved put in his hand by the hole
of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.
I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped
with
 myrrh, and my fingers
with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself,
and
 was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I
am sick of love.
What
is thy beloved more than
another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what
is thy beloved more than
another
 beloved, that thou dost so charge us?
My beloved
is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.
His head
is as the most fine gold, his locks
are
 bushy,
and black as a raven.
His eyes
are as
the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk,
and fitly set.
His cheeks
are as a bed of spices,
as sweet flowers: his lips
like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.
His hands
are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly
is as bright ivory overlaid
with sapphires.
His legs
are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance
is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
His mouth
is most sweet: yea, he
is altogether lovely. This
is my beloved, and this
is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

### Song of Solomon Chapter 6

Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.
My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
I
am my beloved’s, and my beloved
is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.
Thou
art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as
an army with banners.
Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair
is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.
Thy teeth
are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and
there is not one barren among them.
As a piece of a pomegranate
are thy temples within thy locks.
There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.
My dove, my undefiled is
but one; she
is the
only one of her mother, she
is the choice
one
 of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her;
yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
Who
is she
that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun,
and terrible as
an army
 with banners?
I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley,
and to see whether the vine flourished,
and the pomegranates budded.
Or ever I was aware, my soul made me
like the chariots of Amminadib.
Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.


### Song of Solomon Chapter 7

How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince’s daughter! the joints of thy thighs
are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.
Thy navel
is like a round goblet,
which wanteth not liquor: thy belly
is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.
Thy two breasts
are like two young roes
that are
 twins.
Thy neck
is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes
like
 the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose
is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.
Thine head upon thee
is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king
is held in the galleries.
How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters
of grapes.
I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;
And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth
down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
I
am my beloved’s, and his desire
is toward me.
Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.
Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish,
whether the tender grape appear,
and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.
The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates
are all manner of pleasant
fruits, new and old,
which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.


### Song of Solomon Chapter 8

O that thou
wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother!
when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.
I would lead thee,
and bring thee into my mother’s house,
who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
His left hand
should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake
my love, until he please.
Who
is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth
that bare thee.
Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love
is strong as death; jealousy
is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof
are coals of fire,
which hath a most vehement flame.
Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if
a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.
We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
If she
be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she
be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
I
am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand
pieces
 of silver.
My vineyard, which
is mine,
is before me: thou, O Solomon,
must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear
it.Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.

## Part 11: Intertestamental Period

### Historical and Cultural Background: Intertestamental Period

**Historical Context (Between the Testaments: 400 BCE - 4 CE)**

The Intertestamental (or Second Temple) Period spans approximately 400 years between the last Old Testament prophet (Malachi, c. 430 BCE) and the beginning of Jesus' ministry (c. 27-30 CE), encompassing crucial developments in Jewish history, theology, and culture. This period witnessed dramatic political transitions and religious evolution that shaped the world into which Jesus was born. Following Persian rule (539-332 BCE), Alexander the Great conquered the Near East (332 BCE), inaugurating Hellenistic influence that profoundly impacted Jewish life. After Alexander's death (323 BCE), his empire fragmented among his generals (Diadochi), with Judea initially controlled by the Ptolemies of Egypt (323-198 BCE), then the Seleucids of Syria (198-167 BCE). The crisis came under Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-164 BCE) who attempted forced Hellenization, desecrated the Jerusalem temple by sacrificing pigs on the altar, and outlawed Jewish practices (1 Maccabees 1:41-64), triggering the Maccabean Revolt (167-160 BCE). Judah Maccabee and his brothers led successful guerrilla warfare, recaptured Jerusalem, and rededicated the temple (164 BCE)—commemorated by Hanukkah. The Hasmonean dynasty (140-37 BCE) emerged, establishing independent Jewish rule for the first time since 586 BCE, though marked by increasing corruption and internal conflict between religious factions (Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes). Rome intervened in 63 BCE when Pompey conquered Jerusalem, making Judea a client state. Herod the Great (37-4 BCE), an Idumean appointed by Rome, rebuilt the temple magnificently but ruled brutally. This period's developments—Hellenization, apocalyptic literature, sectarian diversity, messianic expectation, and Roman occupation—created the cultural, political, and religious matrix for Jesus' ministry and early Christianity.

**Geographic Setting**

The geographical scope of Jewish life expanded dramatically during the Intertestamental Period as diaspora communities proliferated throughout the Mediterranean and Near East. **Judea** remained the spiritual center, with Jerusalem and its temple as the focal point of Jewish identity despite frequent foreign control. The Hasmonean expansion temporarily extended Jewish territory to include Galilee, Samaria, Idumea, and parts of Transjordan (Perea), approaching the boundaries of David's kingdom, though this proved temporary. **The Diaspora** (dispersion) communities grew substantially: **Egypt**, particularly Alexandria, housed the largest diaspora population (estimated 1 million Jews by the 1st century CE), where the Septuagint (Greek translation of Hebrew Scriptures) was produced (c. 250-100 BCE), enabling Greek-speaking Jews to access their Scriptures. **Mesopotamia** (Babylonia) maintained significant Jewish populations descended from exiles who never returned, developing distinct traditions that later produced the Babylonian Talmud. **Asia Minor**, Greece, and Rome established Jewish communities that would become crucial for early Christian expansion. **Trade routes** connected these diaspora communities: the Via Maris (coastal highway), King's Highway (Transjordan route), and Mediterranean sea lanes facilitated commerce, pilgrimage, and cultural exchange. **Galilee** developed as a distinctly Jewish region following Hasmonean conquest and forced conversion of its inhabitants, becoming Jesus' home region. The geographical expansion meant Judaism evolved from a localized, land-centered religion to a dispersed, Torah-centered faith maintaining cohesion through Scripture, law, and annual pilgrimage to Jerusalem for major festivals (Passover, Pentecost, Tabernacles), creating the "portable" Judaism that could survive the temple's destruction in 70 CE.

**Cultural Context**

The Intertestamental Period witnessed intense cultural conflict between traditional Jewish identity and Hellenistic (Greek) culture, producing lasting impacts on Judaism and Christianity. **Hellenization** introduced Greek language, philosophy, education (gymnasia), architecture, entertainment (theaters, hippodromes), and social customs throughout the Near East. Many Jews adopted Greek names, language, dress, and customs while maintaining Jewish identity—called Hellenistic Judaism. Others fiercely resisted, seeing Hellenization as apostasy threatening covenant faithfulness. **Language shift**: Hebrew increasingly became a liturgical language while Aramaic dominated daily speech in Palestine. Greek became the international language, explaining why the New Testament was written in Greek and diaspora Jews needed the Septuagint translation. **Education systems**: Greek gymnasia competed with traditional Jewish education centered on Torah study in synagogues. **Social stratification** intensified between Hellenized urban elites and rural traditionalists, wealthy aristocratic priestly families and common priests, landowners and peasant farmers. **Religious sectarianism** proliferated: **Pharisees** emphasized Torah interpretation, oral tradition, and personal piety, commanding popular respect despite limited numbers. **Sadducees** represented aristocratic priestly families, controlled the temple, rejected oral tradition and resurrection, and collaborated with foreign rulers. **Essenes** withdrew from mainstream society (some to Qumran by the Dead Sea), practiced communal living, emphasized ritual purity, and expected imminent divine intervention. **Zealots** advocated armed resistance against foreign occupation. This sectarian diversity reflects vigorous religious debate about maintaining Jewish identity under foreign rule. **Literary production** flourished: apocalyptic literature (Daniel, 1 Enoch, 4 Ezra), wisdom literature (Sirach, Wisdom of Solomon), historical accounts (1-2 Maccabees), psalms, prayers, and testaments addressed contemporary crises through theological reflection.

**Political Context**

The Intertestamental Period's political landscape fundamentally shaped Jewish identity and messianic expectations. **Persian Period (539-332 BCE)**: Following Cyrus's decree (539 BCE), Jews enjoyed religious autonomy under Persian administration, governed by high priests and Persian-appointed governors. Persian tolerance allowed temple reconstruction and Torah centralization. **Hellenistic Ptolemaic Rule (323-198 BCE)**: After Alexander's death, Ptolemy I gained control of Judea. Ptolemaic rule was generally benign, permitting Jewish self-governance through the high priest and Sanhedrin (Jewish council). Heavy taxation supported Ptolemaic Egypt's wealth, but Jews maintained religious freedom. **Seleucid Rule (198-167 BCE)**: Antiochus III conquered Judea from Egypt (198 BCE). Initially favorable, relations deteriorated under Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-164 BCE) who needed funds after Roman defeats. His extreme Hellenization program—forbidding circumcision, Sabbath observance, and Torah study; mandating pagan sacrifice; desecrating the temple—triggered the Maccabean Revolt. **Hasmonean Independence (167-63 BCE)**: The Maccabean revolt achieved independence under the Hasmonean dynasty, combining high priesthood with kingship despite not being Davidic or properly Zadokite (priestly line). Initial religious zeal declined into corruption, political intrigue, and civil war between Hasmonean claimants. **Roman Intervention (63 BCE onward)**: Pompey exploited Hasmonean civil war, besieging Jerusalem and entering the Holy of Holies (shocking Jews), making Judea a Roman client state. **Herodian Dynasty (37 BCE-6 CE and beyond)**: Rome appointed Herod the Great, an Idumean convert, as "King of the Jews." Herod rebuilt the temple magnificently, constructed Caesarea Maritima, fortified Masada and Herodium, but ruled brutally, executing anyone threatening his power, including family members. After Herod's death (4 BCE), his kingdom was divided among his sons; Judea eventually became a Roman province (6 CE) governed by prefects/procurators, including Pontius Pilate (26-36 CE).

**Economic Context**

Economic conditions during the Intertestamental Period reflected imperial exploitation, urbanization, and international trade networks. **Agriculture** remained the primary economic base: wheat, barley, olives, grapes, figs, and dates in Palestine's varied microclimates. Peasant farmers faced heavy taxation (Roman imperial taxes, Herodian royal taxes, temple taxes, tithes for priests and Levites) often totaling 30-40% of production, creating chronic debt and land loss to wealthy elites. Archaeological evidence from this period shows increasing economic stratification visible in housing disparities between wealthy urban mansions (e.g., Herodian Jerusalem's Upper City) and poor rural villages. **Trade networks** expanded under Hellenistic and Roman rule: Palestine's location between Egypt and Mesopotamia made it a commercial crossroads. Major ports (Ptolemais, Joppa, Caesarea Maritima built by Herod) connected Mediterranean trade. Caravans transported luxury goods (spices, incense, silk) along desert routes. **Urbanization** increased with Hellenistic and Roman city-building: Greek poleis and Roman colonies introduced monetized market economies, guild systems, and urban poor dependent on patron-client relationships. **Currency**: Multiple coinage systems circulated—Persian, Ptolemaic, Seleucid, Hasmonean, Roman—requiring money-changers (explained at temple). **Temple economy**: The Jerusalem temple functioned as religious center but also economic institution, receiving half-shekel temple tax from Jews worldwide, tithes, sacrificial animals, pilgrimage tourism, and managing substantial wealth. Archaeological discoveries of Herodian period structures show monumental building projects (temple, Caesarea, Masada, Herodium) required massive labor and resources, funded by heavy taxation. Economic tensions between wealthy Hellenized elites and poor rural population contributed to social unrest culminating in the Jewish revolts (66-73 CE, 132-135 CE).

**Religious Context**

The Intertestamental Period witnessed profound religious developments that fundamentally shaped Judaism and provided context for Christian origins. **Synagogue** emerged as central institution: with temple access limited by geography for diaspora Jews and even Palestinian Jews between festivals, synagogues developed as local centers for Torah reading, prayer, and instruction. By Jesus' time, synagogues existed throughout Palestine and the diaspora. **Scripture centralization**: The Septuagint (LXX) translation into Greek (c. 250-100 BCE) in Alexandria made Hebrew Scriptures accessible to Greek-speaking diaspora, becoming the Bible for early Christians. The Hebrew canon was approaching finalization, though debates continued about certain books (Esther, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon). **Torah interpretation**: Oral tradition developed, interpreted biblical law for contemporary circumstances, eventually becoming the Mishnah and Talmud. Pharisaic interpretation emphasized extending Torah observance to all life aspects. **Apocalyptic theology** flourished in response to persecution and foreign rule: books like Daniel, 1 Enoch, 4 Ezra, and 2 Baruch depicted cosmic conflict between good and evil, divine intervention in history, resurrection, final judgment, and the coming kingdom of God. **Messianic expectation** intensified: expectations for a Davidic messiah who would defeat enemies, restore Israel's kingdom, and establish God's reign proliferated in texts like Psalms of Solomon. Some expected priestly and prophetic messiahs alongside royal messiah. **Resurrection belief**: Developed especially among Pharisees, affirming bodily resurrection and afterlife—beliefs Sadducees rejected. **Angels and demons**: Elaborated hierarchies and names (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael; Satan, Belial, Mastema) developed through apocalyptic literature. **Purity concerns**: Intensified focus on ritual cleanliness, dietary laws, Sabbath observance, and separation from Gentiles as identity markers. **Sectarianism**: Diverse groups (Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, Zealots, Samaritans) debated correct interpretation and practice. These developments—synagogue worship, apocalyptic hope, messianic expectation, resurrection belief, Scripture translation—created the religious world into which Jesus was born and early Christianity emerged, explaining much of the New Testament's theological vocabulary and concerns.

## Part 12: Jesus' Ministry

### Historical and Cultural Background: Jesus' Ministry

**Historical Context (The Gospels: c. 6/4 BCE - 30/33 CE)**

Jesus of Nazareth lived and ministered during the Roman imperial period under Augustus Caesar (27 BCE - 14 CE) and Tiberius Caesar (14-37 CE), in a politically complex Palestine divided among Herodian client rulers and direct Roman administration. Jesus' birth date is traditionally celebrated December 25th but scholarly consensus places it between 6-4 BCE (before Herod the Great's death in 4 BCE, Matthew 2:1) based on Luke's reference to Herod's reign and the census. Jesus' public ministry lasted approximately three years (27/28-30/33 CE based on Luke 3:1's synchronism with "the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar" when John the Baptist began preaching). During Jesus' lifetime, Palestine was fragmented: Galilee and Perea were ruled by Herod Antipas (4 BCE - 39 CE, called "that fox" by Jesus, Luke 13:32); Judea, Samaria, and Idumea became a Roman province (6 CE) governed by prefects including Pontius Pilate (26-36 CE); and regions north and east were ruled by Philip the Tetrarch (4 BCE - 34 CE). External historical sources confirm Jesus' existence and crucifixion: Roman historian Tacitus (Annals 15.44, c. 116 CE) mentions "Christus" executed by Pilate; Jewish historian Josephus (Antiquities 18.3.3, c. 93-94 CE) references "Jesus, a wise man" and his crucifixion under Pilate (though the passage shows Christian interpolation); and the Talmud contains hostile references to "Yeshu." Archaeological discoveries illuminate this period: the Pilate Stone (1961) confirmed Pontius Pilate as Judean prefect; Caiaphas ossuary (1990) identified the high priest involved in Jesus' trial; first-century Galilean fishing boats; synagogue remains at Capernaum and elsewhere; and Jerusalem's layout matching Gospel accounts.

**Geographic Setting**

Jesus' ministry centered in **Galilee**, a fertile, densely populated region surrounding the Sea of Galilee (also called Lake Gennesaret or Sea of Tiberias), approximately 13 miles long and 8 miles wide. Galilee was ethnically Jewish following Hasmonean conquest and forced conversion (2nd century BCE), though culturally influenced by surrounding Hellenistic cities (Decapolis). Major towns included: **Nazareth**, Jesus' hometown, a small village (population 200-400) in lower Galilee's hills; **Capernaum**, Jesus' ministry base, a fishing village on the Sea's northwestern shore with synagogue, Peter's house (possibly identified archaeologically), and customs station (Matthew the tax collector worked there); **Bethsaida**, home of Peter, Andrew, and Philip; **Chorazin** and **Cana** where Jesus performed signs. The **Sea of Galilee** provided fish (tilapia, called "St. Peter's fish"), enabled boat travel, and featured in many Gospel accounts (calming storm, walking on water, post-resurrection appearance). Galilee's agricultural abundance (wheat, olives, grapes) contrasted with Judean harshness, making it the "Galilee of the Gentiles" (Isaiah 9:1, Matthew 4:15) due to proximity to Gentile territories. Jesus also traveled to **Judea** for festivals, particularly Jerusalem; the **Decapolis** (ten cities, largely Gentile Greek culture east and south of Galilee); **Samaria** (occasionally, despite Jewish-Samaritan hostility, John 4); regions of **Tyre and Sidon** (Phoenicia); **Caesarea Philippi** far north where Peter confessed Jesus as Messiah; and **Transjordan** (Perea). Jerusalem remained the crucial destination for Jesus' final week (Palm Sunday through resurrection), with specific locations identified: Temple Mount, Gethsemane, Golgotha (Church of the Holy Sepulchre traditional site), and various sites around the city walls.

**Cultural Context**

First-century Palestinian Jewish culture blended traditional Jewish practices with Greco-Roman influences, creating the complex world Jesus navigated. **Language**: Jesus likely spoke **Aramaic** natively (evidenced by preserved Aramaic words: "Talitha koum," "Abba," "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani"), **Hebrew** liturgically and for Scripture reading in synagogues, and possibly conversational **Greek** for interactions with Gentiles and Roman authorities. **Daily life** centered on family, agricultural rhythms, and religious observance. The patriarchal household (extended family) formed the basic social unit. **Social stratification** included: ruling elites (Roman officials, Herodian dynasty, high priestly families), retainers (scribes, tax collectors, estate managers), merchants and artisans (Joseph was a tekton, craftsman/carpenter), peasant farmers and fishermen (most of Jesus' followers), day laborers, and expendables (beggars, prostitutes, lepers, demonized). **Purity concerns** governed daily life: ritual washing before meals, Sabbath observance (no work from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset), dietary laws (kashrut), and avoidance of corpses, skin diseases, and Gentiles to maintain ritual purity for temple worship. **Religious practices** included: daily prayers (Shema, Eighteen Benedictions), annual festivals (Passover, Pentecost/Shavuot, Tabernacles/Sukkot), Sabbath synagogue attendance, circumcision, pilgrimage to Jerusalem. **Honor-shame culture** dominated social interactions: maintaining family honor, avoiding public shame, patron-client relationships, hospitality obligations, and honor challenges (explaining many of Jesus' controversies). **Gender roles**: Rigidly defined, with women's sphere domestic and men's public, though Jesus notably included women among his followers and addressed them publicly (countercultural). **Hellenistic influence**: Greek architecture (theaters in Sepphoris and Tiberias near Nazareth), Roman governance structures, monetary economy (denarii, drachmas), and cosmopolitan trade coexisted with traditional Jewish life, creating tension between accommodation and resistance.

**Political Context**

The political landscape of Jesus' ministry was dominated by Roman imperial power exercised through client rulers and direct administration, creating the volatile situation that led to Jesus' crucifixion and later Jewish revolts. **Roman Empire** under Augustus (27 BCE - 14 CE) and Tiberius (14-37 CE) controlled the Mediterranean world, imposing the Pax Romana through military might, efficient administration, and strategic alliances with local rulers. **Direct Roman rule** in Judea, Samaria, and Idumea (6 CE onward) after Herod Archelaus's incompetent rule was governed by **prefects** (later procurators) appointed by the emperor, residing in Caesarea Maritima (administrative capital) but coming to Jerusalem for major festivals with military reinforcements. **Pontius Pilate** (26-36 CE) governed during Jesus' ministry, known from Josephus and Philo as insensitive to Jewish customs, corrupt, and brutal, eventually recalled for excessive violence. Archaeological confirmation comes from the **Pilate Stone** inscription found at Caesarea Maritima mentioning "Pontius Pilate, Prefect of Judea." **Client rulers**: **Herod Antipas** (4 BCE - 39 CE) ruled Galilee and Perea, building Hellenistic cities (Sepphoris, Tiberias), executing John the Baptist (Mark 6:14-29), and involved in Jesus' trial (Luke 23:6-12). **Philip the Tetrarch** (4 BCE - 34 CE) ruled territories northeast of Galilee more peacefully. **Jewish leadership**: The **Sanhedrin** (Jewish council) held limited authority over internal religious matters, led by the **high priest**. **Caiaphas** (18-36 CE) served as high priest during Jesus' ministry, cooperating with Roman authorities to maintain stability and his family's power. The **Annas family** dominated the high priesthood, controlling temple operations and profits. **Political tensions**: Revolutionary movements (Zealots, sicarii) advocated armed resistance against Rome; messianic claimants periodically arose, typically crushed by Rome; taxation burdens fueled resentment; and Roman military presence provoked nationalist sentiment. Jesus navigated this dangerous terrain, ultimately crucified as "King of the Jews," a political charge of sedition though Roman finding was "I find no guilt in him" (John 18:38). The charge posted on the cross (titulus) read "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews" (INRI), indicating crucifixion for political claims.

**Economic Context**

Economic conditions in early first-century Palestine combined traditional agricultural subsistence with Greco-Roman commercial expansion, creating both opportunity and exploitation. **Agriculture** remained the economic base: Galilean farmers grew wheat and barley (parable of the sower), cultivated vineyards and olive groves (parable of vineyard workers), raised livestock (shepherding metaphors), and fished the Sea of Galilee (Jesus called fishermen as disciples). Archaeological evidence shows terraced hillsides for farming, olive presses, wine production facilities, and fishing equipment (preserved first-century boat at Yigal Allon Museum). **Taxation** oppressed peasant farmers: Roman imperial taxes (tribute/census tax, Mark 12:13-17's "give to Caesar"), Herodian royal taxes, temple taxes (half-shekel annual tax, Matthew 17:24-27), tithes and offerings for priests and Levites, and local tolls/customs duties (Matthew worked as tax collector in Capernaum) potentially totaled 30-50% of production, creating chronic debt, land loss, and social displacement. **Debt and foreclosure**: Jesus' parables frequently reference debtors, creditors, and foreclosure (unmerciful servant, shrewd manager, creditor and debtors), reflecting economic crisis. The **Sabbath year** (debt cancellation every seven years) and **Jubilee** (land return every fifty years, Leviticus 25) were rarely practiced, enabling wealth concentration among elites. **Commerce and trade**: Galilee's location on trade routes, proximity to Hellenistic cities, and diverse production (agricultural goods, fish, wine, oil) created commercial opportunities. **Money economy**: Multiple currencies circulated (Roman denarii, Greek drachmas, Jewish temple shekels), requiring money-changers especially for temple offerings. **Day laborers**: The parable of workers in the vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16) reflects day laborers hired in the marketplace, paid one denarius (survival wage) for a day's work. **Poverty and debt**: Jesus' emphasis on the poor, his followers coming largely from lower economic strata, his critique of wealth's dangers (rich young ruler, Mark 10:17-31; rich fool, Luke 12:13-21; Lazarus and rich man, Luke 16:19-31), and practices like common purse (John 12:6) reflect the economic challenges of his context. Herodian building projects (temple renovation, Tiberias, Sepphoris) required heavy taxation and forced labor, enriching elites while exploiting peasants.

**Religious Context**

The religious world of Jesus' ministry was characterized by diverse Jewish sects, fervent messianic expectation, apocalyptic hope, and Roman religious plurality, creating both the audience for and opposition to Jesus' message. **Jewish sectarian diversity**: **Pharisees**, the most influential group despite small numbers (6,000 according to Josephus), emphasized Torah interpretation, oral tradition (eventually codified as Mishnah), Sabbath and purity observance, and resurrection hope. They controlled synagogues and commanded popular respect. Jesus frequently debated them over legal interpretation. **Sadducees**, aristocratic priestly families controlling the temple and Sanhedrin, rejected oral tradition and resurrection, collaborated with Rome, and disappeared after 70 CE temple destruction. **Essenes**, likely associated with the Qumran community that produced the Dead Sea Scrolls, withdrew from mainstream society, practiced communal living, emphasized ritual purity, and expected imminent divine intervention. Not mentioned in Gospels. **Zealots** advocated armed resistance to Rome. **Scribes** (teachers of the law) interpreted Scripture and taught in synagogues, often associated with Pharisees. **Chief priests** managed temple operations, led sacrificial worship, and controlled temple finances. **Temple worship**: The Jerusalem temple, rebuilt magnificently by Herod the Great (begun 20-19 BCE, completed 64 CE, destroyed 70 CE), served as Judaism's central shrine. Daily sacrifices, festivals, and individual offerings occurred in its precincts. Jesus taught there, prophesied its destruction, and cleansed it by driving out money-changers and sellers. **Synagogue worship**: Local assemblies for Torah reading, prayer, and instruction existed throughout Palestine and diaspora. Jesus regularly taught in synagogues. **Messianic expectations**: Intensified under Roman occupation, with hopes for a Davidic king who would defeat enemies, restore Israel's kingdom, and establish God's reign. Diverse expectations included royal, priestly, and prophetic messiahs. **Apocalyptic hope**: Belief in imminent divine intervention, resurrection, final judgment, and the kingdom of God permeated Jewish thought. John the Baptist and Jesus proclaimed "the kingdom of God is at hand." **Purity practices**: Ritual washing, dietary laws, Sabbath observance, avoidance of corpses and skin diseases, and separation from Gentiles maintained purity for temple worship. Jesus challenged some applications while affirming Torah. **Roman religious context**: Imperial cult (emperor worship), traditional Roman gods, and diverse eastern cults (Isis, Mithras) created religious plurality, though Jews received exemption from emperor worship as religio licita (permitted religion), a status early Christians would lose.

## Matthew

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Matthew's Gospel is traditionally dated to the late 1st century CE, with scholarly debate centering on pre-70 CE (before Jerusalem's destruction) versus post-70 CE composition. Conservative scholars often argue for the 50s-60s CE based on patristic testimony (Papias, Irenaeus) and linguistic analysis, while critical scholars typically date it to 80-90 CE due to theological development, community tensions with synagogue Judaism, and possible knowledge of Mark (if Markan priority is assumed). The Gospel references the destruction of Jerusalem (22:7, 24:2), which some see as prophecy (supporting earlier date) while others view as vaticinium ex eventu (prophecy after the fact, supporting post-70 date). Matthew addresses a Jewish-Christian community navigating identity after the Temple's destruction, debates with Pharisaic Judaism consolidating at Jamnia, and mission to Gentiles. The book presents Jesus as fulfillment of Hebrew Bible prophecy (frequent "fulfillment quotations": 1:22-23, 2:15, 17-18, 23, etc.), engages halakhic (legal) disputes (5:17-48, 12:1-14, 15:1-20), and emphasizes Jesus's role as authoritative teacher of Torah's true meaning. Geographically, Matthew likely originated in Syria (Antioch is traditional location), where Jewish and Gentile Christian communities coexisted amid Pharisaic Judaism's post-70 reorganization. The Gospel's bilingual nature (Hebrew Bible quotations, Aramaic phrases with translations, Greek composition) reflects diaspora Jewish-Christian milieu.

**Author and Audience:** Church tradition from Papias (c. 125 CE, preserved in Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History 3.39) through Irenaeus (c. 180 CE) identifies the author as Matthew the tax collector/apostle (9:9, 10:3), claiming he wrote "in the Hebrew dialect" (likely meaning Aramaic). Modern scholarship debates this attribution: the Gospel is composed in Greek (not translation from Aramaic/Hebrew), shows literary dependence on Mark (according to Markan priority hypothesis), and exhibits theological sophistication suggesting later development. Some defend Matthean authorship arguing the apostle used Mark and Q source, while others propose anonymous Jewish-Christian author writing 50-60 years after Jesus. The Gospel's meticulous Jewish character – genealogy beginning with Abraham (1:1-17), extensive Torah engagement, rabbinic argumentation style, concern for Jewish purity laws and Sabbath – suggests Jewish-Christian authorship deeply versed in Hebrew Bible and scribal traditions. Matthew addresses a community called "church" (ekklēsia, 16:18, 18:17, unique among Gospels), experiencing expulsion from synagogues (as reflected in harsh anti-Pharisaic polemic, ch. 23) yet maintaining Jewish identity while incorporating Gentiles (28:19). The "Sermon on the Mount" (chs 5-7) presents Jesus as new Moses, five major discourses recall Pentateuch structure, and fulfillment quotations demonstrate continuity with Israel's story. The original audience was likely Syrian Jewish Christians navigating post-70 Judaism, defending their messianic claims against Pharisaic objections, and defining community boundaries amid Gentile inclusion.

**Key Themes:** **Jesus as Messiah and Fulfillment of Scripture**: Matthew relentlessly demonstrates Jesus fulfills Hebrew Bible prophecy through "formula quotations" ("This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet...": 1:22, 2:15, 17, 23, 4:14, 8:17, 12:17, 13:35, 21:4, 27:9). The genealogy (1:1-17) structures salvation history in three fourteens (Abraham to David, David to exile, exile to Messiah), presenting Jesus as climax of Israel's story. **Kingdom of Heaven**: Matthew's preferred term (32 times; "kingdom of God" only 4 times) reflects Jewish circumlocution avoiding divine name. The kingdom is "at hand" (4:17), present in Jesus's ministry (12:28), growing mysteriously (parables, ch. 13), and awaiting consummation (25:31-46). **New Moses and Torah Fulfillment**: Jesus ascends a mountain to deliver authoritative teaching (5:1-7:29), giving "new law" that fulfills rather than abolishes Torah (5:17-20). Six antitheses ("You have heard... but I say," 5:21-48) intensify rather than abrogate commandments, presenting Jesus's interpretation as definitive. **Righteousness Exceeding Scribes and Pharisees**: True righteousness surpasses external observance (5:20), demanding internal purity (5:21-30), authentic piety without ostentation (6:1-18), and mercy over sacrifice (9:13, 12:7, quoting Hosea 6:6). **Church/Ekklēsia**: Matthew uniquely uses "church" (16:18, 18:17), addressing community organization (18:15-20), discipline, and authority ("binding and loosing," 16:19, 18:18). **Mission to All Nations**: The Gospel's climax commissions disciples to "make disciples of all nations" (28:19), universalizing Israel's God's reign while maintaining Jewish Messiah's centrality. **Judgment and Eschatology**: Matthew emphasizes final judgment (parables: wheat/tares, sheep/goats, wise/foolish virgins) and ethical accountability (7:21-23, 25:31-46).

**Archaeological Relevance:** While the Gospels primarily concern theology and narrative rather than archaeology, Matthew's 1st century Palestinian setting receives corroboration. **Capernaum**: Archaeological excavations at Tel Hum (Capernaum) reveal 1st century CE basalt synagogue foundations (4th century limestone synagogue built atop), housing insulae, and fishermen's equipment, confirming Matthew's portrayal of Jesus's Galilean ministry base (4:13, 8:5, 9:1). Peter's house, identified by pilgrim inscriptions, shows 1st century domestic occupation. **Temple Mount**: Herodian Temple architecture, massive retaining walls, and platform construction visible today contextualize Matthew's references to Temple teaching (21:12-17, 23:16-22, 24:1-2). The **Western Wall** ("Wailing Wall") preserves Herodian masonry. Jesus's prediction of destruction ("not one stone... left upon another," 24:2) was fulfilled in 70 CE (Josephus, Jewish War 6.249-266). **Pilate and Roman Administration**: The **Pilate Stone** (discovered 1961 at Caesarea Maritima) inscribed "[Pon]tius Pilatus, [Praef]ectus Iuda[eae]" confirms Pilate's governorship and title (prefect, not procurator), corroborating Matthew 27. **Crucifixion**: Archaeological evidence includes **Yehohanan ossuary** (Jerusalem, 1968) containing heel bone pierced by iron nail, demonstrating Roman crucifixion practices. **Burial Practices**: **Rolling stone tomb** excavations (e.g., Herodian family tomb) illustrate Matthew's description of Jesus's burial (27:60). **Coinage**: Coins from Herod the Great, Herod Antipas, and Roman prefects evidence political context (Pilate minted coins 29-31 CE). **Synagogue Architecture**: Remains at Gamla, Magdala, and elsewhere show 1st century synagogue structures where Jesus taught. **Ossuaries and Inscriptions**: 1st century Jewish burial practices, Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek inscriptions on ossuaries evidence multilingual Palestinian Jewish culture Matthew reflects.

**Structure:** Matthew's 28 chapters organize around five major discourses, recalling Pentateuch's five books. **Prologue: Genealogy and Infancy Narratives (1:1-2:23)**: Genealogy (1:1-17), virgin birth (1:18-25), magi visit (2:1-12), flight to Egypt (2:13-23) with multiple fulfillment quotations establishing Jesus's messianic credentials. **Part I (3:1-7:29)**: John's baptism, temptation (3-4), Sermon on the Mount (5-7) – Jesus's inaugural discourse on kingdom ethics. **Part II (8:1-10:42)**: Ten miracles demonstrating messianic authority (8-9), Mission Discourse commissioning twelve for Israel mission (10). **Part III (11:1-13:52)**: Controversies with Jewish leaders (11-12), Parables Discourse revealing kingdom mysteries (13). **Part IV (13:53-18:35)**: Rejection at Nazareth, Peter's confession (16:13-20), transfiguration, Community Discourse on church order and discipline (18). **Part V (19:1-25:46)**: Journey to Jerusalem (19-20), Jerusalem ministry (21-23), Eschatological Discourse predicting Temple destruction and final judgment (24-25). **Passion and Resurrection (26:1-28:20)**: Last Supper, arrest, trial before Sanhedrin and Pilate, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, Great Commission. Each discourse concludes with formula: "When Jesus finished these sayings..." (7:28, 11:1, 13:53, 19:1, 26:1). This five-part structure presents Jesus as new Moses delivering definitive Torah interpretation, climaxing in universal mission commission (28:18-20).

### Matthew Chapter 1

The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;
And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her
that had been the wife of Urias;
And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:
And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
So all the generations from Abraham to David
are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon
are
 fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ
are fourteen generations.
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
Then Joseph her husband, being a just
man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.
But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:
And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.

          For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man
that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.
And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.
Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.
And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right,
that shall ye receive.
So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them
their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
And when they came that
were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.
But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.
And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,
Saying, These last have wrought
but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.
But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
Take
that thine
is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.
Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?
So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,
Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,
And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify
him: and the third day he shall rise again.
Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children with her sons, worshipping
him, and desiring a certain thing of him.
And he said unto her,
What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.
But Jesus answered and said,
Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.
And he saith unto them,
Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but
it shall be given to them
 for whom it is prepared of my Father.
And when the ten heard
it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.
But Jesus called them
unto him, and said,
Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.
But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:
Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord,
thou
 Son of David.
And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord,
thou
 Son of David.
And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said,
What will ye that I shall do unto you?
They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
So Jesus had compassion
on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

### Matthew Chapter 21

And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,
Saying unto them,
Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose
them,
 and bring
them unto me.
And if any
man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.
All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.
And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,
And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set
him thereon.
And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed
them in the way.
And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed
is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,
And said unto them,
It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.
And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased,
And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them,
Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.
Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it,
Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.
And when the disciples saw
it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!
Jesus answered and said unto them,
Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this
which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
And Jesus answered and said unto them,
I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?
But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.
And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them,
Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.          But what think ye? A
certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.
He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.
And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I
go, sir: and went not.
Whether of them twain did the will of
his father?
 They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them,
Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen
it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.
          Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:
And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.
And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.
But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.
And they caught him, and cast
him out of the vineyard, and slew
him.When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?
They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out
his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
Jesus saith unto them,
Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.
But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.


### Matthew Chapter 22

And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,
And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.
Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and
my fatlings
are killed, and all things
are
 ready: come unto the marriage.But they made light of
it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:
And the remnant took his servants, and entreated
them
 spitefully, and slew
them.But when the king heard
thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.
Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.
So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.          And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:
And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast
him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
For many are called, but few
are chosen.Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in
his talk.
And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any
man: for thou regardest not the person of men.
Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?
But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said,
Why tempt ye me,
ye hypocrites?
Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.
And he saith unto them,
Whose
is this image and superscription?
They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them,
Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.
When they had heard
these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.
The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:
Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
And last of all the woman died also.
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
Jesus answered and said unto them,
Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
And when the multitude heard
this, they were astonished at his doctrine.
But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.
Then one of them,
which was a lawyer, asked
him a question,
tempting him, and saying,
Master, which
is the great commandment in the law?
Jesus said unto him,
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
This is the first and great commandment.
And the second
is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him,
The Son of David.
He saith unto them,
How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?
If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?
And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any
man
 from that day forth ask him any more
questions.


### Matthew Chapter 23

Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,
Saying,
The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat:
All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe,
that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.
For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
them on men’s shoulders; but they
themselves
 will not move them with one of their fingers.
But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,
And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,
And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master,
even
 Christ; and all ye are brethren.
And call no
man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.
Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master,
even
 Christ.
But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.          But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in
yourselves,
 neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
Woe unto you,
ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.
Ye fools and blind: for whether
is
 greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.
And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.
And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier
matters
 of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that
which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead
men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.
Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,
And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.
Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
Ye serpents,
ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?          Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and
some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and
some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute
them from city to city:
That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.
Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under
her wings, and ye would not!
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed
is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.


### Matthew Chapter 24

          And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to
him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.
And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what
shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?
And Jesus answered and said unto them,
Take heed that no man deceive you.
For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all
these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
All these
are the beginning of sorrows.
Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.
And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.
When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:
Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:
Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.
And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:
For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.
And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.
Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here
is Christ, or there; believe
it not.
For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if
it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
Behold, I have told you before.
Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold,
he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe
it not.
For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.          Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:
And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:
So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near,
even at the doors.
Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
          But of that day and hour knoweth no
man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
But as the days of Noe
were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,
And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
Two
women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.          Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.
Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.
Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?
Blessed
is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.
Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.
But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;
And shall begin to smite
his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;
The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for
him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,
And shall cut him asunder, and appoint
him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.


### Matthew Chapter 25

          Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
And five of them were wise, and five
were foolish.
They that
were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
But the wise answered, saying,
Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.          For
the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country,
who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made
them other five talents.
And likewise he that
had received two, he also gained other two.
But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
His lord said unto him, Well done,
thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo,
there thou hast
that is thine.
His lord answered and said unto him,
Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and
then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
Take therefore the talent from him, and give
it unto him which hath ten talents.
For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.          When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth
his sheep from the goats:
And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed
thee? or thirsty, and gave
thee
 drink?
When saw we thee a stranger, and took
thee in? or naked, and clothed
thee?
Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done
it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done
it unto me.
Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did
it not to one of the least of these, ye did
it not to me.
And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

### Matthew Chapter 26

And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,
Ye know that after two days is
the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill
him.
But they said, Not on the feast
day, lest there be an uproar among the people.
Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat
at meat.
But when his disciples saw
it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose
is this waste?
For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
When Jesus understood
it, he said unto them,
Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did
it for my burial.
Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world,
there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,
And said
unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
Now the first
day of the
feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
And he said,
Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.
And as they did eat, he said,
Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?
And he answered and said,
He that dippeth
his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.
The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.
Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him,
Thou hast said.And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed
it,
 and brake
it, and gave
it to the disciples, and said,
Take, eat; this is my body.
And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave
it to them, saying,
Drink ye all of it;
For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.
And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
Then saith Jesus unto them,
All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
Peter answered and said unto him, Though all
men shall be offended because of thee,
yet will I never be offended.
Jesus said unto him,
Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples,
Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.
And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
Then saith he unto them,
My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying,
O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou
wilt.
And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed
is willing, but the flesh
is weak.
He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying,
O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them,
Sleep on now, and take
your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.
And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
And Jesus said unto him,
Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out
his
 hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.
Then said Jesus unto him,
Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes,
Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.
Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
And they that had laid hold on Jesus led
him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.
Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;
But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came,
yet
 found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
And said, This
fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what
is it which these witness against thee?
But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
Jesus saith unto him,
Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote
him with the palms of their hands,
Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?
Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
But he denied before
them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
And when he was gone out into the porch, another
maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This
fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.
And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
And after a while came unto
him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art
one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.
Then began he to curse and to swear,
saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.


### Matthew Chapter 27

When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:
And when they had bound him, they led
him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What
is that to us? see thou
to that.
And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.
And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.
Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.
And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him,
Thou sayest.
And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.
Now at
that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.
And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?
For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.
Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?
They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.
And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but
that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed
his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye
to it.
Then answered all the people, and said, His blood
be on us, and on our children.
Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered
him to be crucified.
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band
of soldiers.
And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put
it
 upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.
And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify
him.
And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.
And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,
They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted
thereof, he would not drink.
And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.
And sitting down they watched him there;
And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.
And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,
And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest
it
 in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.
Likewise also the chief priests mocking
him, with the scribes and elders, said,
He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.
He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.
Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say,
My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Some of them that stood there, when they heard
that, said, This
man calleth for Elias.
And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled
it with vinegar, and put
it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.
Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;
And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,
And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.
When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:
He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.
And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,
Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.
Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.
Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make
it
 as sure as ye can.
So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.

## Mark

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Mark is widely considered the earliest Gospel, dated by most scholars to 65-75 CE, likely just before or shortly after Jerusalem's destruction in 70 CE. The Gospel's urgency, persecution references (8:34-38, 13:9-13), apocalyptic expectations (ch. 13), and lack of knowledge of the Temple's actual destruction suggest composition during the Jewish War (66-70 CE) or immediately after. Church tradition (Papias, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria) connects Mark to Peter's preaching in Rome, and internal evidence supports Roman provenance: Latin loanwords (centurion, legion, census, denarius), explanation of Jewish customs for Gentile readers (7:3-4, 15:42), and geographic imprecisions suggesting author unfamiliarity with Palestine. Some scholars place composition in Syria, but Roman context during Neronian persecution (64 CE) or aftermath of the Jewish revolt provides plausible setting. Mark addresses a persecuted community needing encouragement that suffering and martyrdom characterize authentic discipleship. Unlike Matthew and Luke, Mark shows little interest in Jesus's birth or extended teaching blocks, instead emphasizing Jesus's actions – his powerful works demonstrating God's kingdom breaking into the world. The Gospel's abrupt ending (16:8, with later manuscripts adding verses 9-20) leaves readers with fear and wonder at the empty tomb, inviting continuation of Jesus's story through the believing community.

**Author and Audience:** Patristic tradition unanimously identifies the author as John Mark, companion of Paul (Acts 12:12, 25; 13:5, 13; 15:37-39; Colossians 4:10; Philemon 24; 2 Timothy 4:11) and interpreter/associate of Peter (1 Peter 5:13 calls Mark "my son"). Papias (c. 125 CE, via Eusebius) states Mark "became Peter's interpreter and wrote accurately all that he remembered... of the things said or done by the Lord," though "not in order." This Peter-Mark connection explains the Gospel's vivid details, Aramaic preservations, and Peter-centered narratives (especially Peter's failures: 8:33, 14:29-31, 66-72). However, modern scholars note the Gospel is anonymous, the tradition may reflect later attempts to establish apostolic authority, and Markan priority in the Synoptic relationship complicates direct Petrine authorship. Whether by John Mark or anonymous author, the Gospel addresses Gentile Christians (explaining Jewish customs, translating Aramaic: talitha cumi 5:41, corban 7:11, Bartimaeus 10:46, Golgotha 15:22, Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani 15:34) facing persecution. Mark emphasizes Jesus's suffering and call to cross-bearing discipleship (8:34-38), appropriate for a community experiencing martyrdom. The "messianic secret" motif (Jesus silencing demons and commanding secrecy: 1:34, 44; 3:12; 5:43; 7:36; 8:30) may address triumphalist christologies, insisting Jesus's messiahship is understood only through crucifixion. The Gospel's ending (16:8) with women fleeing the empty tomb in fear challenges readers to continue Jesus's mission.

**Key Themes:** **Suffering Son of Man**: Mark's Christology centers on the "Son of Man" who "came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" (10:45). Three passion predictions (8:31, 9:31, 10:32-34) structure the journey to Jerusalem, emphasizing suffering, death, and resurrection as Jesus's destiny. **Messianic Secret**: Jesus repeatedly commands silence about his identity (1:34, 44; 3:12; 5:43; 8:30) and uses parables obscuring understanding (4:11-12), preventing premature messianic proclamation before crucifixion reveals messiahship's meaning. Only at the cross does a centurion confess "Truly this man was God's Son!" (15:39), the Gospel's climactic recognition. **Kingdom of God**: Inaugurated in Jesus's ministry ("The kingdom of God has come near," 1:15), present in healings and exorcisms (3:27), revealed in parables (ch. 4), and awaiting consummation (9:1, 13:24-27, 14:25). **Discipleship as Cross-Bearing**: True discipleship requires denying self, taking up one's cross, and following Jesus (8:34-38). The Twelve consistently misunderstand Jesus (8:32-33, 9:32-34, 10:35-45), fail in Gethsemane (14:37-42), and flee at arrest (14:50), modeling flawed discipleship redeemed by resurrection promise (16:7). **Conflict with Religious Authorities**: Early Galilean controversies (2:1-3:6) escalate to Jerusalem confrontations (11:27-12:40), climaxing in trial and crucifixion orchestrated by chief priests and scribes. **Jesus's Authority**: Demonstrated through exorcisms (1:21-28, 5:1-20), healings (1:29-34, 40-45, 2:1-12, 5:21-43), nature miracles (4:35-41, 6:45-52), and authoritative teaching surpassing scribes (1:22). **Apocalyptic Expectation**: Chapter 13's "Little Apocalypse" warns of tribulation, false messiahs, cosmic signs, and the Son of Man's coming, urging watchfulness (13:33-37).

**Archaeological Relevance:** Mark's 1st century Palestinian and Roman contexts receive archaeological corroboration. **Capernaum**: Excavations confirm 1st century village, basalt synagogue foundations, and Peter's house (domus ecclesia tradition), contextualizing Jesus's Galilean ministry base (1:21, 2:1). **Gerasene Region**: The Decapolis city where Jesus exorcised Legion into swine (5:1-20) reflects Hellenistic cities of the region; **Gerasa (Jerash)** and **Gadara** show monumental architecture from this period, illustrating cultural clash between Jewish purity concerns and Gentile territory. **Jerusalem Temple**: Herodian Temple Mount architecture, visible in massive retaining walls and platform, contextualizes Jesus's Temple action (11:15-19) and prediction of destruction (13:1-2). **Pilate**: The **Pilate Stone** confirms his governorship and title (prefect), corroborating Passion narrative (15:1-15). **Crucifixion**: The **Yehohanan ossuary** (1968) with heel bone pierced by crucifixion nail demonstrates Roman execution methods Mark describes (15:24-25). **Burial Practices**: Rolling stone tombs excavated in Jerusalem (e.g., Herodian family tomb) illustrate Mark 15:46-16:4. **Synagogue Architecture**: 1st century synagogues at Gamla, Magdala, and Capernaum evidence structures where Jesus taught (1:21, 3:1, 6:2). **Fishing Industry**: Galilee boat discovery (1986, "Jesus boat") from 1st century BCE/CE preserves fishing vessel type disciples used (1:16-20, 4:36-38). **Roman Military**: Archaeological evidence of Roman legions, centurions, and crucifixion practices corroborates Mark's military references (legion 5:9, centurion 15:39).

**Structure:** Mark's 16 chapters (with 16:9-20 as later addition) follow a tightly structured narrative. **Prologue (1:1-13)**: John the Baptist, Jesus's baptism and temptation, establishing Jesus's identity as "Son of God" (1:1, 11). **Part I: Galilean Ministry (1:14-8:26)**: Inaugurating kingdom proclamation (1:14-15), calling disciples (1:16-20), Capernaum ministry with exorcisms and healings (1:21-45), controversy stories with Pharisees (2:1-3:6), parables discourse (4:1-34), mighty works (sea stilling, exorcisms, healings, feedings: 4:35-8:26). This section emphasizes Jesus's authority but growing misunderstanding. **Part II: Journey to Jerusalem (8:27-10:52)**: Peter's confession at Caesarea Philippi (8:27-30), first passion prediction (8:31-33), transfiguration (9:2-13), second passion prediction (9:30-32), teaching on discipleship, third passion prediction (10:32-34), climaxing with blind Bartimaeus receiving sight (10:46-52) as Jesus approaches Jerusalem. This central section redefines messiahship through suffering. **Part III: Jerusalem Ministry (11:1-13:37)**: Triumphal entry (11:1-11), Temple cleansing (11:15-19), controversies with authorities (11:27-12:40), widow's offering (12:41-44), eschatological discourse predicting Temple destruction and tribulation (ch. 13). **Passion and Resurrection (14:1-16:8)**: Anointing at Bethany, Last Supper, Gethsemane, arrest, trial before Sanhedrin and Pilate, crucifixion, burial, empty tomb with angelic announcement and women's fearful flight (16:8). The Gospel's abrupt ending (manuscripts diverge: some end at 16:8, others add 16:9-20, a few add alternative short ending) leaves readers with unresolved tension, inviting participation in Jesus's ongoing story. Mark's fast-paced narrative ("immediately" appears 42 times) conveys urgency and divine action breaking into history.

### Mark Chapter 7

Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.
For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash
their
 hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
And
when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold,
as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.
Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?
He answered and said unto them,
Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with
their
 lips, but their heart is far from me.
Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching
for doctrines the commandments of men.
For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men,
as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.
And he said unto them,
Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:
But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother,
It is
 Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
he shall be free.
And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.And when he had called all the people
unto him, he said unto them,
Hearken unto me every one
of you, and understand:
There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.
If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
And he saith unto them,
Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man,
it cannot defile him;
Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?
And he said,
That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.
For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:
All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.
And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know
it:
 but he could not be hid.
For a
certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:
The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
But Jesus said unto her,
Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast
it unto the dogs.
And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.
And he said unto her,
For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.
And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.
And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.
And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;
And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him,
Ephphatha,
 that is,
Be opened.
And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.
And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published
it;
And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.


### Mark Chapter 8

In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples
unto him, and saith unto them,
I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:
And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.
And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these
men with bread here in the wilderness?
And he asked them,
How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before
them; and they did set
them before the people.
And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before
them.
So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken
meat that was left seven baskets.
And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.
And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith,
Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.
And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.
Now
the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.
And he charged them, saying,
Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and
of the leaven of Herod.
And they reasoned among themselves, saying,
It is because we have no bread.
And when Jesus knew
it, he saith unto them,
Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?
Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.
And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.
And he said unto them,
How is it that ye do not understand?
          And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.
And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.
And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.
After that he put
his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.
And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell
it to any in the town.          And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?
And they answered, John the Baptist: but some
say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
And he saith unto them,
But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.
And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.
And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and
of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.
But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying,
Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.          And when he had called the people
unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.
For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

### Mark Chapter 9

And he said unto them,
Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.And after six days Jesus taketh
with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.
And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.
And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.
And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.
And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.
And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.
And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.
And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.
And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?
And he answered and told them,
Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.
But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.And when he came to
his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.
And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to
him saluted him.
And he asked the scribes,
What question ye with them?
And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;
And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.
He answereth him, and saith,
O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.
And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
And he asked his father,
How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.
And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.
Jesus said unto him,
If thou canst believe, all things
are
 possible to him that believeth.
And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him,
Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.
And
the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.
But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.
And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
And he said unto them,
This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know
it.
For he taught his disciples, and said unto them,
The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.
But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.
And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them,
What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?
But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who
should be the greatest.
And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them,
If any man desire to be first,
the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.
And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,
Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.
And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.
But Jesus said,
Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.
For he that is not against us is on our part.
For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.
And whosoever shall offend one of
these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:
Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:
Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
Salt
is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.

### Mark Chapter 10

And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.
And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away
his wife? tempting him.
And he answered and said unto them,
What did Moses command you?
And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put
her away.
And Jesus answered and said unto them,
For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.
But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.
For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;
And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.
What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same
matter.
And he saith unto them,
Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.
And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and
his disciples rebuked those that brought
them.
But when Jesus saw
it, he was much displeased, and said unto them,
Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
And he took them up in his arms, put
his hands upon them, and blessed them.
And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
And Jesus said unto him,
Why callest thou me good?
there is
 none good but one,
that is, God.
Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.
And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.
Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him,
One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.
And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.
And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples,
How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them,
Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?
And Jesus looking upon them saith,
With men
it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.
Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.
And Jesus answered and said,
Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,
But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.
But many
that are first shall be last; and the last first.And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,
Saying,Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:
And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.
And he said unto them,
What would ye that I should do for you?
They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.
But Jesus said unto them,
Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them,
Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:
But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but
it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.
And when the ten heard
it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.
But Jesus called them
to him, and saith unto them,
Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.
But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:
And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.
For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.
And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus,
thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal,
Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.
And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.
And Jesus answered and said unto him,
What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.
And Jesus said unto him,
Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.

### Mark Chapter 11

And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,
And saith unto them,
Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring
him.
And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.
And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.
And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.
And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.
And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed
them in the way.
And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed
is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:
Blessed
be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.
And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:
And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not
yet.
And Jesus answered and said unto it,
No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard
it.
And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;
And would not suffer that any man should carry
any vessel through the temple.
And he taught, saying unto them,
Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.
And the scribes and chief priests heard
it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.
And when even was come, he went out of the city.
And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.
And Jesus answering saith unto them,
Have faith in God.
For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.
Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive
them, and ye shall havethem.
And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.
But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,
And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?
And Jesus answered and said unto them,
I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
The baptism of John, was
it from heaven, or of men? answer me.
And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all
men
 counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.
And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them,
Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

### Mark Chapter 12

And he began to speak unto them by parables.
A
certain
 man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about
it,
 and digged
a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.
And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.
And they caught
him, and beat him, and sent
him away empty.
And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded
him in the head, and sent
him
 away shamefully handled.
And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.
Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.
But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.
And they took him, and killed
him, and cast
him out of the vineyard.
What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.
And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:
This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.
And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in
his words.
And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them,
Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may seeit.
And they brought
it. And he saith unto them,
Whose
is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.
And Jesus answering said unto them,
Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him.
Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave
his wife
behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.
And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.
In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
And Jesus answering said unto them,
Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?
For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.
And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I
am
 the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?
And Jesus answered him,
The first of all the commandments
is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:
And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.
And the second
is like,
namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.
And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:
And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love
his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him,
Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him
any question.
And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple,
How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?
For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he
then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
And he said unto them in his doctrine,
Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and
love salutations in the marketplaces,
And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:
Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.
And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
And he called
unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,
Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:
For all
they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had,
even all her living.

### Mark Chapter 13

And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings
are here!
And Jesus answering said unto him,
Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
Tell us, when shall these things be? and what
shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?
And Jesus answering them began to say,
Take heed lest any
man
 deceive you:
For many shall come in my name, saying, I am
Christ; and shall deceive many.
And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for
such things must needs be; but the end
shall not
be yet.
For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these
are the beginnings of sorrows.
          But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.
And the gospel must first be published among all nations.
But when they shall lead
you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.
Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against
their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.
And ye shall be hated of all
men for my name’s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
          But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:
And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter
therein, to take any thing out of his house:
And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.
But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!
And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.
For
in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.
And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.
And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here
is Christ; or, lo,
he is there; believe
him
 not:
For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if
it were possible, even the elect.
But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.          But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.
Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:
So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh,
even at the doors.
Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.
Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
          But of that day and
that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.
Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.
Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:
Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.

### Mark Chapter 14

After two days was
the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put
him to death.
But they said, Not on the feast
day, lest there be an uproar of the people.
And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured
it on his head.
And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?
For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
And Jesus said,
Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.
For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.
She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.
Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world,
this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.
And when they heard
it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.
And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?
And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them,
Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.
And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
And he will shew you a large upper room furnished
and
 prepared: there make ready for us.
And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.
And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said,
Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.
And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one,
Is it I? and another
said, Is it I?
And he answered and said unto them,
It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.
The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake
it, and gave to them, and said,
Take, eat: this is my body.
And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave
it
 to them: and they all drank of it.
And he said unto them,
This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.
Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
And Jesus saith unto them,
All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet
will
 not I.
And Jesus saith unto him,
Verily I say unto thee, That this day,
even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.
But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.
And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples,
Sit ye here, while I shall pray.
And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;
And saith unto them,
My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.
And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
And he said,
Abba, Father, all things
are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.
And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,
Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?
Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly
is ready, but the flesh
is weak.
And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.
And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.
And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them,
Sleep on now, and take
your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and the scribes and the elders.
And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead
him away safely.
And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.
And they laid their hands on him, and took him.
And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
And Jesus answered and said unto them,
Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and
with staves to take me?
I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.
And they all forsook him, and fled.
And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about
his naked
body; and the young men laid hold on him:
And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.
And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.
And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,
We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.
But neither so did their witness agree together.
And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what
is it which these witness against thee?
But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
And Jesus said,
I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?
Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.
And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:
And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is
one of them.
And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art
one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth
thereto.
But he began to curse and to swear,
saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.
And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him,
Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.

## Luke

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Luke-Acts forms a two-volume work dated by most scholars to 80-90 CE, though some argue for earlier (60s CE) or later (early 2nd century) composition. Luke's prologue (1:1-4) indicates he writes after "many" previous accounts (likely including Mark), consulted eyewitnesses and ministers of the word, and conducted careful investigation to provide "orderly account" for Theophilus. The Gospel post-dates Mark (assuming Markan priority), reflects developed theological perspectives, and shows no awareness of Paul's letters despite Acts' extensive Paul narratives, suggesting composition after Paul's death (mid-60s CE). The Gospel's treatment of Jerusalem's destruction (19:41-44, 21:20-24) is more detailed than Mark's, possibly indicating knowledge of the 70 CE event, though this could be prophetic insight. Luke addresses a Gentile audience familiar with Greco-Roman literary conventions, as evidenced by classical Greek prologue (1:1-4), omission of Jewish customs explanations (contrast Mark), sophisticated Greek style (best among Gospels), and concern for Roman officials (Pilate declared Jesus innocent three times: 23:4, 14, 22). The two-volume work traces salvation history from Jesus's birth to Paul's Rome imprisonment, demonstrating Christianity's fulfillment of Hebrew Bible promises while establishing its legitimacy within the Roman Empire as non-threatening movement. Luke situates Jesus's birth during Augustus's census (2:1-2), ministry beginning in Tiberius's 15th year (3:1-2), and resurrection appearances occurring in Jerusalem (not Galilee as in Mark/Matthew), linking Christian origins to world history.

**Author and Audience:** Church tradition from the Muratorian Canon (c. 170 CE) through Irenaeus identifies the author as Luke, Paul's "beloved physician" and travel companion (Colossians 4:14, Philemon 24, 2 Timothy 4:11). The "we" passages in Acts (16:10-17, 20:5-15, 21:1-18, 27:1-28:16) suggest author accompanied Paul on portions of his journeys. However, modern scholarship notes Luke-Acts is anonymous, the "we" passages may be literary convention or incorporate source material, and the author's portrayal of Paul differs from Paul's letters (on Law, apostolic council, theology). Whether by Luke the physician or anonymous author, the writer is highly educated (best Greek in NT), familiar with Septuagint, knowledgeable about Mediterranean geography and politics, and writes for Theophilus ("lover of God," 1:3, Acts 1:1), possibly a patron or representative of intended Gentile Christian audience. The address "most excellent Theophilus" suggests high social status. Luke addresses Gentile Christians needing assurance (asphaleian, "certainty," 1:4) about their faith's trustworthiness, its continuity with Israel's history, and its compatibility with Roman civilization. The Gospel emphasizes Jesus's concern for marginalized groups – women (8:1-3, 10:38-42, 23:27-31), poor (6:20, 16:19-31), Samaritans (10:29-37, 17:11-19), tax collectors and sinners (5:27-32, 15:1-2, 19:1-10) – demonstrating God's inclusive salvation. Luke's universalism appears in Jesus's genealogy extending to Adam (3:23-38, unlike Matthew's Abraham start), Simeon's "light for revelation to the Gentiles" (2:32), and Great Commission to "all nations" (24:47).

**Key Themes:** **Orderly Salvation History**: Luke traces God's plan from John the Baptist's birth through Jesus's ministry, death, resurrection, ascension, and the church's Spirit-empowered mission (Acts), presenting Christianity as climax of Israel's story. **Universal Salvation**: Jesus came to seek and save the lost (19:10), with salvation offered to all people – Jews, Gentiles, Samaritans, women, poor, outcasts. Simeon prophesies Jesus is "light for revelation to the Gentiles" (2:32). **Holy Spirit's Role**: The Spirit features prominently: empowering Jesus's conception (1:35), descending at baptism (3:22), driving Jesus's ministry (4:1, 14, 18), and promised to disciples (24:49, fulfilled Acts 2). **Prayer**: Jesus prays at crucial moments (3:21, 5:16, 6:12, 9:18, 28-29, 11:1, 22:32, 41, 23:34, 46), modeling prayerful dependence. **Concern for Poor and Outcasts**: Beatitudes bless the poor (6:20), Mary's Magnificat celebrates God lifting the lowly (1:52-53), Jesus dines with tax collectors and sinners (5:29-32, 15:1-2, 19:1-10), and warns rich about wealth's dangers (12:13-21, 16:19-31, 18:18-30). **Women's Prominence**: Elizabeth, Mary, Anna (1-2), women disciples supporting Jesus's ministry (8:1-3), Mary and Martha (10:38-42), women at cross and tomb (23:49-24:11) receive unprecedented attention. **Joy**: The Gospel radiates joy from angelic announcements (1:14, 2:10) through resurrection (24:52). **Journey to Jerusalem**: Luke's central section (9:51-19:44) narrates extended journey toward Jesus's destiny in Jerusalem, where he must "be received up" (9:51). **Table Fellowship**: Meals scenes reveal kingdom dynamics – eating with sinners (5:29-32, 15:1-2), Pharisee meals (7:36-50, 11:37-54, 14:1-24), Last Supper (22:14-38), Emmaus meal (24:13-35).

**Archaeological Relevance:** Luke's historical and geographical details receive archaeological corroboration, though some debates persist. **Census of Quirinius**: Luke 2:1-2 dates Jesus's birth to Augustus's census when Quirinius governed Syria. Josephus (Antiquities 18.1-2) describes Quirinius's census in 6 CE, creating chronological tension with Herod the Great's death (4 BCE). Some scholars propose earlier Quirinius governorship or distinguish enrollment from taxation, while skeptics view this as Luke's historical error. **Inscription evidence** confirms Quirinius was legate of Syria but debate continues on timing. **Pilate**: **Pilate Stone** (Caesarea, 1961) confirms Pontius Pilate as prefect of Judea, corroborating Luke's Passion narrative. **Gallio**: Acts 18:12-17 mentions Gallio as proconsul of Achaia; the **Gallio Inscription** (Delphi, discovered 1905) dates his proconsulship to 51-52 CE, providing key chronological anchor for Paul's ministry and Luke's historical reliability. **Erastus**: Acts 19:22, Romans 16:23 mention Erastus; **Erastus Inscription** (Corinth) reading "Erastus, commissioner of public works, laid this pavement at his own expense" may reference same person. **Politarchs**: Acts 17:6, 8 uses "politarchs" for Thessalonian officials, a term found on **Thessalonica inscriptions**, confirming Luke's accurate local terminology. **Synagogues**: Archaeological remains at Capernaum, Gamla, Magdala, and elsewhere evidence 1st century synagogue architecture Luke describes. **Caesarea Maritima**: Excavations reveal Herodian harbor, theater, and administrative buildings, contextualizing Luke's references to this Roman capital (Acts 23:23, 25:1). **Geography**: Luke's Mediterranean itinerary in Acts shows accurate knowledge of sea routes, cities, and local conditions.

**Structure:** Luke's 24 chapters follow carefully structured narrative. **Prologue (1:1-4)**: Classical Greek preface explaining methodology and purpose, dedicating work to Theophilus. **Infancy Narratives (1:5-2:52)**: Parallel announcements of John and Jesus's births (1:5-56), births and childhood (1:57-2:40), Jesus at Temple age twelve (2:41-52). These chapters uniquely preserve Mary's perspective and emphasize God's reversal of fortunes. **Preparation for Ministry (3:1-4:13)**: John's preaching (3:1-20), Jesus's baptism (3:21-22), genealogy to Adam (3:23-38), temptation (4:1-13). **Galilean Ministry (4:14-9:50)**: Nazareth rejection (4:14-30), Capernaum ministry (4:31-44), calling disciples (5:1-11), controversies (5:12-6:11), Twelve chosen (6:12-16), Sermon on the Plain (6:17-49), miracles and teaching (7:1-9:50). **Journey to Jerusalem (9:51-19:44)**: Luke's distinctive central section featuring unique parables (Good Samaritan 10:25-37, Rich Fool 12:13-21, Prodigal Son 15:11-32, Rich Man and Lazarus 16:19-31, Pharisee and Tax Collector 18:9-14) and discipleship teaching, all oriented toward Jesus's climactic "exodus" in Jerusalem (9:31). **Jerusalem Ministry (19:45-21:38)**: Temple teaching, controversies, eschatological discourse. **Passion Narrative (22:1-23:56)**: Last Supper, arrest, trials before Sanhedrin, Pilate, and Herod Antipas (unique to Luke), crucifixion with promise to repentant thief (unique), burial. **Resurrection (24:1-53)**: Empty tomb, Emmaus road (unique), Jerusalem appearances, ascension (also narrated in Acts 1). Luke's Gospel uniquely ends in Jerusalem (not Galilee) with joyful worship in the Temple, preparing for Acts' narrative beginning in Jerusalem at Pentecost.

### Luke Chapter 21

And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.
And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.
And he said,
Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:
For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.
And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,
As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign
will there be when these things shall come to pass?
And he said,
Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am
Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.
But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end
is not by and by.
Then said he unto them,
Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.
But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute
you, delivering
you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake.
And it shall turn to you for a testimony.
Settle
it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:
For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.
And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and
some of you shall they cause to be put to death.
And ye shall be hated of all
men for my name’s sake.
But there shall not an hair of your head perish.
In your patience possess ye your souls.
And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.
Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.
For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.
And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.          And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.
And he spake to them a parable;
Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;
When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.
So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.
Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.
Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
          And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.
For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called
the mount of Olives.
And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.


### Luke Chapter 22

Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.
And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.
And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.
And he sent Peter and John, saying,
Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.
And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
And he said unto them,
Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.
And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
And he said unto them,
With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:
For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said,
Take this, and divide
it among yourselves:
For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake
it, and gave unto them, saying,
This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.
Likewise also the cup after supper, saying,
This cup
is
 the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.          But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me
is with me on the table.
And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!
And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.
And he said unto them,
The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.
But ye
shall not
be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
For whether
is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth?
is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.
Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.
And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;
That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.And the Lord said,
Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired
to have you, that he may sift
you as wheat:
But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.
And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.
And he said,
I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.
And he said unto them,
When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.
Then said he unto them,
But now, he that hath a purse, let him take
it, and likewise
his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.
For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.
And they said, Lord, behold, here
are two swords. And he said unto them,
It is enough.And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.
And when he was at the place, he said unto them,
Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,
Saying,
Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.
And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.
And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,
And said unto them,
Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.
But Jesus said unto him,
Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.
And Jesus answered and said,
Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.
Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him,
Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?
When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.Then took they him, and led
him, and brought him into the high priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off.
And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.
But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.
And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this
fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.
And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.
And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote
him.
And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?
And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,
Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them,
If I tell you, ye will not believe:
And if I also ask
you, ye will not answer me, nor let
me go.
Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.
Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them,
Ye say that I am.
And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.


### Luke Chapter 23

And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this
fellow
 perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.
And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said,
Thou sayest
it.
Then said Pilate to the chief priests and
to the people, I find no fault in this man.
And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.
When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long
season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.
Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked
him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined
him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.
I will therefore chastise him, and release
him.
(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this
man,
 and release unto us Barabbas:
(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
But they cried, saying, Crucify
him, crucify him.
And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let
him go.
And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear
it after Jesus.
And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
But Jesus turning unto them said,
Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed
are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.
Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
Then said Jesus,
Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided
him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.
And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.
And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
And Jesus said unto him,
Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said,
Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.
Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
And, behold,
there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor;
and he was a good man, and a just:
(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;)
he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
This
man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.
And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.


### Luke Chapter 24

Now upon the first
day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain
others with them.
And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
And as they were afraid, and bowed down
their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
And they remembered his words,
And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.
It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary
the mother of James, and other
women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.
And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.
Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem
about threescore furlongs.
And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
And it came to pass, that, while they communed
together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.
But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.
And he said unto them,
What manner of communications
are
 these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?
And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?
And he said unto them,
What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:
And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.
But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;
And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.
And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found
it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.
Then he said unto them,
O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:
Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?
And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.
But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed
it, and brake, and gave to them.
And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,
Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
And they told what things
were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.
And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them,
Peace
be unto you.
But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.
And he said unto them,
Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them
his hands and
his feet.
And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them,
Have ye here any meat?
And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.
And he took
it, and did eat before them.
And he said unto them,
These
are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and
in the prophets, and
in the psalms, concerning me.
Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,
And said unto them,
Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
And ye are witnesses of these things.          And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.
And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.
And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

## John

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** The Fourth Gospel is typically dated to 90-100 CE, though debate ranges from 65 CE to early 2nd century. The Gospel's theological maturity, developed Christology, reflection on Jesus's significance for Greek-speaking audiences, and apparent knowledge of Synoptic traditions suggest later composition. Church tradition (Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Eusebius) places composition in Ephesus during John's old age, after the Synoptics. The Gospel reflects a community expelled from synagogue ("aposunagōgos," 9:22, 12:42, 16:2), suggesting post-Jamnia (c. 85-90 CE) Jewish-Christian tensions when Birkat ha-Minim (blessing against heretics) may have formalized separation. John addresses a community defining identity against both synagogue Judaism (emphasizing Jesus's superiority to Moses, Torah, Temple, festivals) and competing Christian groups (possibly early Gnostic tendencies, docetism). The Gospel's "high Christology" (Jesus as pre-existent Logos, equal with God) represents theological development from Synoptic presentations, though some scholars argue Johannine tradition preserves independent early material. The Johannine epistles (1-3 John) and Revelation share vocabulary, themes, and likely community connections, suggesting a "Johannine circle" producing multiple texts. P52 (John Rylands papyrus fragment), dated to c. 125-150 CE and containing John 18:31-33, 37-38, provides terminus ante quem (latest possible date) for composition and demonstrates rapid spread to Egypt.

**Author and Audience:** Church tradition from Irenaeus (c. 180 CE) identifies the author as John son of Zebedee, the "Beloved Disciple" mentioned in the Gospel (13:23, 19:26, 20:2, 21:7, 20, 24). The Gospel concludes "This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things... we know that his testimony is true" (21:24), suggesting communal endorsement of eyewitness testimony. However, modern scholarship debates authorship: the Gospel is anonymous, refers to the Beloved Disciple in third person, exhibits theological sophistication suggesting reflective development rather than immediate eyewitness report, and differs dramatically from Synoptics in chronology, geography, and teaching style. Some propose John the Elder (distinct from the apostle, mentioned by Papias) or a "Johannine school" preserving John's teaching in literary form. The Gospel addresses a Greek-speaking community familiar with Jewish traditions but needing explanation of Hebrew/Aramaic terms (Rabbi 1:38, Messiah 1:41, Siloam 9:7, Golgotha 19:17), engaging both Jewish audiences (demonstrating Jesus fulfills Torah and prophets) and Gentile philosophical concerns (Logos concept, light/darkness dualism). The community faces internal divisions (1 John addresses secessionists) and external opposition from "the Jews" (used polemically 70+ times, reflecting synagogue-church conflict, not ethnic animosity). John's purpose statement declares "these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name" (20:31).

**Key Themes:** **Logos Christology**: The prologue's "Word became flesh" (1:14) presents Jesus as pre-existent divine Logos, creator of all (1:3), revealing God (1:18). This high Christology pervades: "I AM" statements (echoing Exodus 3:14) identify Jesus with Yahweh (6:35, 8:12, 10:11, 11:25, 14:6, 15:1), claims of pre-existence ("before Abraham was, I AM," 8:58), and unity with Father ("I and the Father are one," 10:30). **Signs and Belief**: John selects seven "signs" (sēmeia) – water to wine (2:1-11), official's son (4:46-54), paralytic (5:1-15), feeding 5000 (6:1-15), walking on water (6:16-21), blind man (9:1-41), Lazarus (11:1-44) – to evoke faith in Jesus's identity. Each sign reveals Jesus's glory and invites response. **Life and Light**: Jesus offers eternal life (3:16, 5:24, 6:40, 10:10, 17:3) beginning now, not merely future, transforming believers. He is "light of the world" (8:12, 9:5) dispelling darkness (1:5, 3:19-21, 12:35-36). **Dualistic Language**: Light/darkness, truth/falsehood, above/below, spirit/flesh, life/death structure Johannine thought, though not absolute ontological dualism – darkness cannot overcome light (1:5). **Love**: God's love motivates sending the Son (3:16), Jesus's love drives his sacrifice (13:1, 15:13), and disciples must love one another (13:34-35, 15:12, 17). **Holy Spirit/Paraclete**: Extended Farewell Discourse (chs 13-17) promises the Paraclete (Advocate, Comforter), the Spirit of truth who will teach, testify, convict, and guide believers (14:16-17, 26; 15:26; 16:7-15). **Realized Eschatology**: While future resurrection and judgment appear (5:28-29, 6:39-40), John emphasizes present realities – eternal life possessed now (3:36, 5:24), judgment occurring in response to Jesus (3:18-19), resurrection life experienced in belief (11:25-26). **Witness/Testimony**: John the Baptist, Jesus's works, Scripture, the Father, the Beloved Disciple, and the Spirit all testify to Jesus's identity, creating cumulative case for belief.

**Archaeological Relevance:** John's Gospel, despite theological emphasis, contains striking historical and archaeological corroboration. **Pool of Bethesda**: John 5:2 describes a pool "by the Sheep Gate... which has five porticoes." For centuries this seemed legendary, but **excavations** near St. Anne's Church in Jerusalem uncovered a double pool with five porticoes (four around sides, one dividing middle), exactly matching John's description, dated to Herodian period. **Pool of Siloam**: John 9:7 mentions Siloam pool where Jesus sent the blind man. In 2004, **excavations** exposed monumental steps and pool from Second Temple period, distinct from Byzantine pool traditionally identified. **Gabbatha/Lithostrotos**: John 19:13 places Pilate's judgment seat on "stone pavement" (lithostrotos, Hebrew Gabbatha). **Excavations** at Fortress Antonia site reveal paving stones from Herodian period, though exact identification remains debated. **Jacob's Well**: John 4:6 sets Jesus-Samaritan woman encounter at Jacob's well near Sychar. A deep well at Tell Balata (ancient Shechem) has been identified with this site since early Christian centuries. **Geographical Precision**: John's Palestinian geography is often more accurate than Synoptics – Cana, Bethany beyond Jordan, Aenon near Salim (3:23), Ephraim (11:54) show topographical knowledge. **Pilate**: **Pilate Stone** confirms his governance. **Crucifixion Details**: John's passion account contains historically plausible details – victim carrying crossbeam (19:17), legs broken to hasten death (19:31-33), side pierced (19:34) – corroborated by **Yehohanan ossuary** showing crucifixion nail and leg trauma. **Dead Sea Scrolls**: Qumran texts share dualistic language (light/darkness, truth/falsehood), teacher of righteousness concepts, and community meal practices, showing John's thought is rooted in Jewish sectarian milieu, not purely Hellenistic.

**Structure:** John's 21 chapters (ch. 21 appears as epilogue) divide distinctly from Synoptics. **Prologue (1:1-18)**: Theological overture introducing Logos Christology, light/darkness dualism, witness theme, and incarnation. **Book of Signs (1:19-12:50)**: Seven signs and discourse cycles revealing Jesus's identity to the world: Week of testimony and first disciples (1:19-51); Cana wedding (2:1-11); Temple cleansing (2:12-25); Nicodemus discourse on rebirth (3:1-21); John's final testimony (3:22-36); Samaritan woman on living water (4:1-42); Second sign: official's son (4:43-54); Third sign: paralytic and Sabbath discourse (5:1-47); Fourth sign: feeding 5000 and bread of life discourse (6:1-71); Feast of Tabernacles debates (7:1-8:59); Fifth sign: blind man and good shepherd discourse (9:1-10:42); Sixth sign: Lazarus raised (11:1-44); Seventh sign's aftermath: plot to kill Jesus, anointing, triumphal entry (11:45-12:19); Greeks seek Jesus, final public teaching (12:20-50). **Book of Glory (13:1-20:31)**: Jesus's "hour" arrives, revealing glory through crucifixion-exaltation: Farewell Discourse begins with foot washing (13:1-30), continuing with extended teaching on love, Spirit, union with Christ, persecution (13:31-16:33); High Priestly Prayer (17:1-26); Passion: arrest (18:1-11), trials before Annas, Caiaphas, Pilate (18:12-19:16), crucifixion (19:17-37), burial (19:38-42); Resurrection: empty tomb (20:1-10), Mary Magdalene (20:11-18), disciples (20:19-23), Thomas (20:24-29), purpose statement (20:30-31). **Epilogue (21:1-25)**: Galilean appearance, miraculous catch, Peter's restoration, Beloved Disciple's fate. John's structure emphasizes Jesus's signs revealing glory to provoke faith, climaxing in the ultimate sign – cross as glorification, throne as throne of glory, descent into death as ascent to the Father.

### John Chapter 1

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God.
All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
There was a man sent from God, whose name
was John.
The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all
men through him might believe.
He was not that Light, but
was sent to bear witness of that Light.
That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God,
even to them that believe on his name:
Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.
And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.
For the law was given by Moses,
but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.
No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared
him.
And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?
And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.
And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.
Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
He said, I
am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.
And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?
John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.
These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.
This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.
And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.
And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.
And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.
Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!
And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them,
What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?
He saith unto them,
Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.
One of the two which heard John
speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.
And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said,
Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.
The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him,
Follow me.
Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him,
Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him,
Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.
Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
Jesus answered and said unto him,
Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.
And he saith unto him,
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

### John Chapter 2

And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.
Jesus saith unto her,
Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.
His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do
it.
And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
Jesus saith unto them,
Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
And he saith unto them,
Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare
it.
When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse:
but thou hast kept the good wine until now.
This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;
And said unto them that sold doves,
Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.
And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
Jesus answered and said unto them,
Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
But he spake of the temple of his body.
When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast
day,
 many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all
men,
And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.


### John Chapter 3

There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
Jesus answered and said unto him,
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?
Jesus answered,
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and
of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
Jesus answered and said unto him,
Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you
of heavenly things?
And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven,
even the Son of man which is in heaven.          And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.          For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.          He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.
For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
For John was not yet cast into prison.
Then there arose a question between
some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.
And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all
men come to him.
John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.
Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
He must increase, but I
must decrease.
He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.
And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.
He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.
For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure
unto him.
The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.


### John Chapter 4

When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
And he must needs go through Samaria.
Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with
his journey, sat thus on the well:
and it was about the sixth hour.
There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her,
Give me to drink.
(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
Jesus answered and said unto her,
If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?
Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
Jesus answered and said unto her,
Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
Jesus saith unto her,
Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her,
Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.
The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
Jesus saith unto her,
Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
God
is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship
him in spirit and in truth.
The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
Jesus saith unto her,
I that speak unto thee am
he.And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
But he said unto them,
I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him
ought to eat?
Jesus saith unto them,
My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
Say not ye, There are yet four months, and
then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.
So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
And many more believed because of his own word;
And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard
him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
Then said Jesus unto him,
Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
Jesus saith unto him,
Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.
And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told
him,
 saying, Thy son liveth.
Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
So the father knew that
it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him,
Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.
This
is again the second miracle
that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.

## Part 13: Early Church

### Historical and Cultural Background: Early Church

**Historical Context (Apostolic Era: 30-70 CE)**

The Early Church period spans from Jesus' resurrection and Pentecost (c. 30/33 CE) through the apostolic generation, ending with the temple's destruction (70 CE) and the deaths of the apostles. This period witnessed Christianity's transformation from a Jewish messianic sect to an increasingly Gentile movement spreading throughout the Roman Empire. Key events include: Pentecost (Acts 2), establishing the Jerusalem church; Stephen's martyrdom (c. 34-35 CE) triggering dispersion and evangelism; Saul/Paul's conversion (c. 33-36 CE); Peter's vision and Cornelius's conversion opening Gentile mission; Antioch becoming the first significant mixed Jewish-Gentile congregation; Paul's missionary journeys (c. 46-57 CE) establishing churches throughout Asia Minor, Greece, and Rome; the Jerusalem Council (c. 49-50 CE, Acts 15) deciding Gentile converts need not follow full Torah; and persecution under Nero (64-68 CE) following Rome's great fire. External sources confirm early Christian existence: Roman historians Tacitus (Annals 15.44), Pliny the Younger (Letters 10.96-97 to Trajan, c. 112 CE), and Suetonius (Claudius 25) reference Christians; Josephus mentions James "the brother of Jesus who was called Christ" (Antiquities 20.9.1); and archaeological evidence includes the Gallio Inscription (Delphi) dating Paul's Corinthian ministry to 51-52 CE, Erastus inscription (Corinth), and early Christian inscriptions in Rome's catacombs. The period ended with Jerusalem's destruction by Rome (70 CE), fundamentally altering Judaism and accelerating Christianity's separation from its Jewish matrix.

**Geographic Setting**

Christianity expanded rapidly from Jerusalem throughout the Roman Empire along trade routes and through diaspora synagogue networks. The movement began in **Jerusalem** and **Judea**, where the earliest believers were Jewish Christians attending the temple and synagogues. Following Stephen's martyrdom, believers scattered to **Samaria** (Philip's mission, Acts 8), **Damascus** (where Paul converted), **Antioch in Syria** (first major mixed church, launching point for missions), and **coastal cities** like Caesarea, Joppa, and Ptolemais. Paul's missions extended the gospel to **Asia Minor** (modern Turkey): Galatia, Phrygia, Pamphylia, Lycia, and major cities like Ephesus, Colossae, and Laodicea. In **Europe**, churches were established in Macedonia (Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea) and Achaia (Athens, Corinth). Paul reached **Rome** (c. 60-62 CE) as a prisoner, joining an existing Christian community. Tradition claims other apostles traveled widely: Thomas to India, Mark to Egypt (founding Alexandria's church), and Peter eventually to Rome. The **diaspora synagogue network** provided initial platforms for proclamation, as Paul regularly entered synagogues first in each city before persecution drove him to Gentile audiences. Archaeological evidence confirms many cities mentioned in Acts: Ephesus's theater, Corinth's bema (judgment seat) where Paul appeared before Gallio, Philippi's Roman colony layout, and Caesarea's harbor and theater.

**Cultural Context**

The Early Church navigated diverse cultural contexts as it spread from Jewish Palestinian origins through Hellenistic cities to Rome. **Urban context**: Christianity was primarily an urban movement initially, establishing churches in major cities connected by Roman roads and sea routes—Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, Philippi, Thessalonica, Rome. Cities provided infrastructure, diaspora synagogues, diverse populations, and communication networks. **Social composition**: Early believers came from diverse social strata: slaves (Onesimus), freedmen, merchants (Lydia, purple cloth seller), artisans (Paul, Aquila, and Priscilla as tentmakers), wealthy patrons (Phoebe, Gaius), and occasionally aristocrats (Erastus, city treasurer in Corinth). Women played significant roles as patrons, house church leaders, and ministers (Phoebe, Priscilla, Lydia, Junia). **Language**: Greek (koine) served as the common language, explaining why the New Testament was written in Greek. Paul and other missionaries moved fluidly in Hellenistic culture while maintaining Jewish identity. **Household structure**: Churches met in house churches (oikos), leveraging existing patron-client relationships. Conversion of household heads often meant entire household conversions (Cornelius, Lydia, Philippian jailer). **Honor-shame culture**: Persecution, public insults, and social marginalization created shame early Christians reinterpreted through cruciform theology. **Voluntary associations**: Early churches resembled Greco-Roman collegia (guilds/associations), providing social support, common meals, and mutual aid, though with distinctive theology and boundary markers.

**Political Context**

The Early Church developed under Roman imperial rule during the reigns of Tiberius (14-37 CE), Caligula (37-41 CE), Claudius (41-54 CE), and Nero (54-68 CE), facing increasing tension with both Roman authorities and Jewish leadership. Initially, Romans viewed Christianity as a Jewish sect (religio licita), providing legal protection. Claudius's edict (c. 49 CE) expelling Jews from Rome due to "Chrestus"-related disturbances (likely Christian-Jewish conflicts over Jesus as Messiah) first distinguished Christians politically (Acts 18:2; mentioned by Suetonius). Nero blamed Christians for Rome's great fire (64 CE), initiating systematic persecution including Peter and Paul's martyrdoms (tradition dates to 64-68 CE). Tacitus (Annals 15.44) confirms Neronian persecution's brutality. In Palestine, Jewish Christian tensions escalated: Acts describes arrests, beatings, and trials before the Sanhedrin. James the apostle was executed under Herod Agrippa I (44 CE, Acts 12:2), and James the brother of Jesus by the Sanhedrin (62 CE, per Josephus). The Jewish Revolt (66-70 CE) against Rome ended with Jerusalem's destruction, the temple's burning, and massive Jewish casualties, fundamentally altering Judaism and accelerating Jewish-Christian separation. Christians fled Jerusalem to Pella (Transjordan) before the siege, distancing themselves from Jewish nationalism and revolt, contributing to the breach between Judaism and Christianity. Roman governance structures, proconsuls, and local authorities appear throughout Acts, showing Christianity navigating imperial legal systems.

**Economic Context**

The Early Church's economic practices reflected diverse contexts from Jerusalem's communalism to diaspora churches' patronage systems. The **Jerusalem church** initially practiced property sharing ("had all things in common," Acts 2:44-45; 4:32-37), possibly motivated by eschatological expectation, pilgrims staying in Jerusalem, or egalitarian ideals, though this arrangement proved unsustainable, requiring famine relief from Antioch (Acts 11:27-30). **Patronage and benefaction**: Wealthy believers like Lydia (Acts 16:14-15), Jason (Acts 17:5-9), and Gaius (Romans 16:23) hosted churches, funded missions, and provided legal protection, operating within Greco-Roman patron-client relationships. Women patrons like Phoebe (Romans 16:1-2, prostatis/"patron") played crucial roles. **Paul's tentmaking**: Paul often supported himself through manual labor (tentmaking, Acts 18:3; 1 Cor 4:12; 1 Thess 2:9), maintaining independence though accepting support occasionally (Philippians 4:10-19). This was countercultural as elites disdained manual labor. **Collection for Jerusalem**: Paul organized an extensive relief fund from Gentile churches (Galatia, Macedonia, Achaia) for Jerusalem's impoverished believers (Romans 15:25-27; 1 Cor 16:1-4; 2 Cor 8-9), expressing Gentile solidarity with Jewish Christians and theological unity. **Trade and travel**: Christianity spread along commercial trade routes, with believers like Aquila and Priscilla conducting business while establishing churches (Acts 18:2-3; Romans 16:3-5). The Mediterranean's unified market under Roman peace (Pax Romana) facilitated missionary expansion. Economic tensions included class differences in church assemblies (1 Cor 11:17-22, the wealthy eating first at Lord's Supper), slavery issues (Philemon), and maintaining the poor (Acts 6:1-6, widows' distribution).

**Religious Context**

The Early Church emerged from Judaism while increasingly including Gentiles, creating identity tensions and requiring theological articulation of Christian distinctives. **Jewish matrix**: Initial believers were Torah-observant Jews who attended temple (Acts 2:46; 3:1) and synagogues, viewing Jesus as Messiah fulfilling Jewish hopes. The question became: must Gentile converts become Jews (circumcision, Torah observance) to follow the Jewish Messiah? **Jerusalem Council** (Acts 15, c. 49-50 CE) decided Gentiles need not fully convert to Judaism, requiring only abstention from idolatry, sexual immorality, strangled animals, and blood—a compromise enabling table fellowship. **Pauline theology**: Paul articulated justification by faith apart from Torah observance (Galatians, Romans), redefining covenant membership around faith in Christ rather than ethnic/ritual markers. This created a "third race" (Jews, Gentiles, Christians) transcending ethnic categories. **Worship practices**: Early Christians gathered on "the Lord's Day" (Sunday, resurrection day), practiced baptism (initiation rite), celebrated the Lord's Supper/Eucharist (commemorating Jesus' death), sang hymns (Philippians 2:5-11; Col 1:15-20), read apostolic letters, and shared prophetic utterances and teachings. **Spiritual gifts**: Charismata (gifts of the Spirit—prophecy, tongues, healing, teaching) characterized worship, especially in Corinth, requiring Pauline regulation (1 Cor 12-14). **Separation from Judaism**: Factors driving separation included Gentile inclusion without full conversion, christological claims (Jesus as divine), Sabbath/Sunday distinction, temple destruction (70 CE), and mutual excommunication (Christian exclusion from synagogues reflected in John's Gospel). **Imperial cult tension**: While Judaism enjoyed emperor worship exemption, Christianity's growth among Gentiles removed this protection. Christians' refusal to participate in civic religion (sacrificing to emperor, traditional gods) created social friction, though systematic empire-wide persecution awaited later centuries. **Mission**: The Great Commission (Matt 28:18-20) and apostolic preaching focused on Jesus' resurrection, messiahship, salvific death, and imminent return, creating urgency for evangelism.

## Acts

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Acts, the second volume of Luke's two-part work, is dated to 80-90 CE by most scholars, though debate ranges from early 60s CE (based on abrupt ending with Paul's Roman imprisonment, possibly indicating composition before his death) to early 2nd century. The traditional "early date" argues Acts ends c. 62 CE because it doesn't mention Paul's death (mid-60s CE), Nero's persecution (64 CE), or Jerusalem's destruction (70 CE), suggesting Luke wrote before these events. However, most scholars favor later dating: Acts shows knowledge of Paul's death (20:25, 38; 21:13), reflects developed church structure, demonstrates theological distance from events (depicting idealized, conflict-free early church), and corresponds with Luke's Gospel dating (80-90 CE). The book traces Christianity's expansion from Jerusalem (Jewish context) to Rome (Gentile world capital), covering roughly 30-62 CE. Acts addresses Gentile Christians (like Luke's Gospel) needing to understand Christianity's Jewish roots, its legitimacy as fulfillment of Hebrew Bible promises, and its compatibility with Roman civilization. Luke presents Christianity as religio licita (legal religion) deserving Roman protection, repeatedly showing Roman officials declaring Christians innocent (Gallio 18:12-17, Festus 25:25, Agrippa 26:31-32). The narrative also addresses internal church questions: Gentile inclusion (ch. 10, 15), Spirit's role, church leadership, and relationship to Judaism. Acts serves as bridge between Gospels and Epistles, providing historical context for Paul's letters.

**Author and Audience:** Acts shares authorship with Luke's Gospel (both addressed to Theophilus, 1:1; Luke 1:3), traditionally identified as Luke the physician, Paul's companion (Colossians 4:14, 2 Timothy 4:11, Philemon 24). The "we" passages (16:10-17, 20:5-15, 21:1-18, 27:1-28:16) suggest author accompanied Paul on portions of missionary journeys, though these may be literary convention or incorporated source material. Modern scholarship notes Acts' portrayal of Paul differs from Paul's self-presentation in his letters: Acts emphasizes Law observance (21:20-26), depicts harmonious apostolic council (ch. 15, contrast Galatians 2), and presents Paul's theology differently. Whether by Luke or anonymous author, the writer demonstrates literary skill, historical interest, and theological purpose. Luke-Acts addresses Theophilus ("most excellent," Luke 1:3, possibly a patron or Roman official) and broader Gentile Christian audience needing assurance about their faith's origins, continuity with Israel, and respectability within Roman society. Acts presents Christianity as prophetic fulfillment (2:16-21, 3:18-26, 13:32-37), not political threat, despite Jewish opposition. The audience faces questions about Gentile inclusion (resolved by Jerusalem Council, ch. 15), the Spirit's empowerment (Pentecost onwards), and Christian identity vis-à-vis Judaism. Luke's sophisticated Greek, knowledge of Mediterranean geography, and concern for social status (noting conversions of prominent people: Ethiopian eunuch, Cornelius, Sergius Paulus, Lydia, Philippian jailer, Areopagus members) suggest educated, urban, Gentile Christian readership.

**Key Themes:** **Holy Spirit's Empowerment**: Pentecost (2:1-13) fulfills Jesus's promise (1:8), empowering witness "to the ends of the earth." The Spirit guides mission (8:29, 10:19, 13:2, 16:6-7), confirms Gentile inclusion (10:44-48, 15:8), and empowers bold proclamation. **Witness and Mission**: Jesus's final words structure the book: "You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth" (1:8), traced through concentric expansion. **Apostolic Preaching (Kerygma)**: Speeches follow pattern: Jesus fulfilled Scripture, was crucified, God raised him, repentance brings forgiveness and the Spirit (2:14-39, 3:12-26, 10:34-43, 13:16-41). **Gentile Inclusion**: God-fearers and Gentiles receive the Gospel: Ethiopian eunuch (8:26-40), Cornelius (ch. 10), Antioch church (11:19-26), apostolic council (ch. 15) declares circumcision unnecessary. **Continuity with Israel**: Christianity fulfills Hebrew Bible promises (2:16-21, 3:18-26, 13:32-37, 15:15-18), with Paul consistently preaching in synagogues first before turning to Gentiles (13:46, 18:6, 28:28). **Church Unity**: Despite conflicts (6:1, 11:2-3, 15:1-2), Acts emphasizes harmony, sharing (2:44-45, 4:32-37), and consensus (6:5, 15:22-29). **Suffering and Persecution**: Disciples face opposition from Jewish authorities (4-5, 7, 9:1-2, 13-14) and Gentiles (16:19-24, 19:23-41), modeling faithful witness amid suffering. **Divine Sovereignty**: God directs mission through visions (9:10-16, 10:9-16, 16:9-10, 18:9-10, 27:23-24), miraculous deliverances (5:19, 12:6-11, 16:25-26), and providential circumstances.

**Archaeological Relevance:** Acts receives extensive archaeological corroboration, enhancing confidence in Luke's historical reliability. **Gallio Inscription** (Delphi, Greece): Documents Gallio as proconsul of Achaia, dates his term to 51-52 CE, providing crucial chronological anchor for Paul's Corinthian ministry (18:12-17) and entire Pauline chronology. **Erastus Inscription** (Corinth): Stone pavement inscription "Erastus, commissioner of public works, laid this pavement at his own expense" possibly references Erastus mentioned in Acts 19:22, Romans 16:23. **Politarchs** (Thessalonica): Acts 17:6-8 uses "politarchs" for Thessalonian officials; multiple **Thessalonica inscriptions** confirm this unusual term, demonstrating Luke's accurate local knowledge. **Sergius Paulus**: Inscriptions from Cyprus reference Paulus family, corroborating Acts 13:7's proconsul. **Theater at Ephesus**: Excavated 25,000-seat theater matches Acts 19:29's riot location. **Areopagus** (Athens): Archaeological remains of Council of Areopagus meeting place on Mars Hill, where Paul spoke (17:22-34). **Caesarea Maritima**: Excavations reveal Herodian harbor, theater, hippodrome, and administrative buildings, illustrating Roman capital where Paul was imprisoned (23:23-26:32). **Philippi**: Archaeological remains include Roman forum, theater, and Via Egnatia road, contextualizing Paul's ministry (16:12-40). **Corinthian Canal**: Geography matches Acts' travel descriptions. **Malta Shipwreck**: Acts 27-28's nautical details (ship types, wind patterns, anchoring, reef dangers) demonstrate accuracy; Maltese tradition identifies St. Paul's Bay. **First Century Ships**: Underwater archaeology confirms ship types, anchors, and maritime practices Luke describes. **Diana/Artemis Temple** (Ephesus): One of Seven Wonders, excavated remains show massive scale explaining silversmiths' riot (19:23-41).

**Structure:** Acts' 28 chapters trace Christianity's expansion from Jerusalem to Rome, following Jesus's commission structure (1:8). **Prologue (1:1-11)**: Recaps Jesus's resurrection appearances, ascension, and mission mandate: "witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, to the ends of the earth" (1:8). **Part I: Jerusalem Church (1:12-8:3)**: Matthias replaces Judas (1:12-26), Pentecost (2:1-47), apostolic miracles and teaching (3:1-4:31), communal life (4:32-5:11), Sanhedrin opposition (5:12-42), choosing seven deacons (6:1-7), Stephen's martyrdom (6:8-8:3). This section establishes Jerusalem as mission's center, with 3,000 (2:41) then 5,000 (4:4) believing. **Part II: Judea and Samaria (8:4-12:25)**: Philip in Samaria and Gaza (8:4-40), Saul's conversion (9:1-31), Peter's ministry to Cornelius demonstrating Gentile inclusion (10:1-11:18), Antioch church (11:19-30), James martyred and Peter imprisoned (12:1-25). This section expands mission beyond Jerusalem, culminating in Gentile Pentecost (10:44-48). **Part III: Paul's Missionary Journeys to "Ends of the Earth" (13:1-28:31)**: First Journey: Cyprus and Asia Minor (13:1-14:28); Jerusalem Council resolves Gentile question (15:1-35); Second Journey: Macedonia and Achaia (15:36-18:22) including Philippi, Thessalonica, Athens, Corinth; Third Journey: Ephesian ministry and return to Jerusalem (18:23-21:16); Paul's Arrest and Trials: Jerusalem mob, Sanhedrin, Felix, Festus, Agrippa (21:17-26:32); Journey to Rome: Shipwreck and arrival (27:1-28:16); Rome Ministry: Paul's two-year house arrest preaching "with all boldness and without hindrance" (28:17-31). Acts concludes not with Paul's fate but mission's success: Gospel reached Rome, capital of the world, fulfilling Jesus's commission. The open ending (Paul under house arrest) invites readers to continue the mission.

### Acts Chapter 6

And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples
unto them,
 and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.
Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:
Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid
their hands on them.
And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
Then there arose certain of
the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.
And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.
Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and
against God.
And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon
him, and caught him, and brought
him to the council,
And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:
For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.
And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.


### Acts Chapter 7

Then said the high priest, Are these things so?
And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.
Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.
And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not
so much as
 to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when
as yet he had no child.
And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat
them
 evil four hundred years.
And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.
And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so
Abraham
 begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac
begat
 Jacob; and Jacob
begat the twelve patriarchs.
And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,
And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.
But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.
And at the second
time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.
Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to
him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor
the father
 of Sychem.
But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.
The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.
In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father’s house three months:
And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.
And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
And seeing one
of them suffer wrong, he defended
him,
 and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:
For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.
And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?
But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?
Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.
And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.
When Moses saw
it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold
it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,
Saying, I
am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.
Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.
I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send
to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.
He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.
This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and
with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:
To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust
him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,
Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for
as for
 this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices
by the space of forty years in the wilderness?
Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.
Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;
Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.
But Solomon built him an house.
Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,
Heaven
is my throne, and earth
is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what
is the place of my rest?
Hath not my hand made all these things?
Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers
did, so
do ye.
Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:
Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept
it.
When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with
their teeth.
But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,
And cast
him out of the city, and stoned
him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.
And they stoned Stephen, calling upon
God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.


### Acts Chapter 8

And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
And devout men carried Stephen
to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.
As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed
them to prison.
Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.
Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.
And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed
with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
And there was great joy in that city.
But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.
And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.
But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:
(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
Then laid they
their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.
And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,
Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.
But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.
For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and
in
 the bond of iniquity.
Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.
And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.
And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,
Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.
Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.
And Philip ran thither to
him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.
And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?
Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.
And as they went on
their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See,
here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.
But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.


### Acts Chapter 9

And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,
And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:
And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him,
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said,
I am Jesus whom thou persecutest:
it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord
said unto him,
Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.
And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought
him into Damascus.
And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision,
Ananias. And he said, Behold, I
am here, Lord.
And the Lord
said unto him,
Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for
one
 called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,
And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting
his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.
Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:
And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.
But the Lord said unto him,
Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:
For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.
And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord,
even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.
And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.
And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.
And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.
But all that heard
him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?
But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.
And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:
But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
Then the disciples took him by night, and let
him down by the wall in a basket.
And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.
But Barnabas took him, and brought
him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.
Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.
And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all
quarters,
 he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.
And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.
And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.
And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.
Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.
And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid
her in an upper chamber.
And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring
him
 that he would not delay to come to them.
Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.
But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning
him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
And he gave her
his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.
And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.
And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.


### Acts Chapter 10

There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian
band,
A devout
man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.
He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.
And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.
And now send men to Joppa, and call for
one Simon, whose surname is Peter:
He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.
And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;
And when he had declared all
these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.
On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:
And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,
And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:
Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
And there came a voice to him,
Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.
And the voice
spake unto him again the second time,
What God hath cleansed,
that call not thou common.
This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,
And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.
While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.
Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.
Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what
is the cause wherefore ye are come?
And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.
Then called he them in, and lodged
them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.
And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped
him.
But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.
And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
Therefore came I
unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?
And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.
Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of
one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.
Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.
Then Peter opened
his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:
But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.
The word which
God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)
That word,
I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.
And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:
Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;
Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God,
even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.
And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God
to be the Judge of quick and dead.
To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.
While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.
And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.
For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,
Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.

### Acts Chapter 11

And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,
Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.
But Peter rehearsed
the matter from the beginning, and expounded
it by order unto them, saying,
I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:
Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
And I heard a voice saying unto me,
Arise, Peter; slay and eat.
But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.
But the voice answered me again from heaven,
What God hath cleansed,
that call not thou common.
And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.
And the spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house:
And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;
Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.
And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.
Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said,
John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as
he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?
When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.
Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.
And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.
And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.
Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.
Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.
For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.
Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:
And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.
And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.
Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:
Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.


### Acts Chapter 12

Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth
his hands to vex certain of the church.
And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
And when he had apprehended him, he put
him in prison, and delivered
him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.
Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.
And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.
And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon
him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from
his hands.
And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.
And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.
When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.
And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and
from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
And when he had considered
the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.
And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.
And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.
And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.
But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened
the door,
 and saw him, they were astonished.
But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.
Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.
And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that
they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and
there abode.
And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king’s
country.
And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.
And the people gave a shout,
saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.
And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.
But the word of God grew and multiplied.
And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled
their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.


### Acts Chapter 13

Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.
And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid
their hands on them, they sent
them away.
So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to
their minister.
And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name
was Bar-jesus:
Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.
But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.
Then Saul, (who also
is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,
And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief,
thou child of the devil,
thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
And now, behold, the hand of the Lord
is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.
Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.
But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.
And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying,
Ye men
and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.
Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with
his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.
The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.
And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.
And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.
And after that he gave
unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.
And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.
And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the
son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.
Of this man’s seed hath God according to
his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus:
When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not
he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of
his feet I am not worthy to loose.
Men
and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled
them in condemning
him.
And though they found no cause of death
in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.
And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took
him down from the tree, and laid
him in a sepulchre.
But God raised him from the dead:
And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.
And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,
God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead,
now
 no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.
Wherefore he saith also in another
psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:
But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.
Be it known unto you therefore, men
and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:
And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;
Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.
And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.
Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.
But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.
Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
For so hath the Lord commanded us,
saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.
And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.
But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.
But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.
And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.

**Historical Timeframe:** Romans is dated with unusual certainty to winter 57/58 CE, written from Corinth during Paul's third missionary journey (Acts 20:2-3). Internal evidence supports this: Paul mentions Phoebe from Cenchreae (Corinth's port, 16:1), staying with Gaius (1 Corinthians 1:14 identifies Corinthian Gaius), references Erastus the city treasurer (16:23, matching Corinthian Erastus inscription), and describes his collection for Jerusalem saints nearly complete (15:25-26), placing composition shortly before his final Jerusalem visit (Acts 21:17). Paul writes having completed ministry "from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum" (15:19) and planning to visit Rome en route to Spain (15:24-28). Rome's church already existed (founded by unknown Jewish Christians, possibly Pentecost pilgrims, Acts 2:10) and Paul had not yet visited (1:10-13, 15:22-24), making Romans unique among Pauline letters as addressed to a church he didn't found. The letter's formal, comprehensive theological exposition (contrasting with situational letters like Galatians or Corinthians) reflects Paul introducing himself and his gospel to an established community. Romans contextually addresses mid-50s CE tensions: Claudius's 49 CE expulsion of Jews from Rome (Acts 18:2) had separated Jewish and Gentile Christians; Claudius's death (54 CE) allowed Jewish Christians' return, creating reunification tensions over Law observance, dietary practices, and community leadership. Paul writes to unify Jewish and Gentile believers around his "gospel" (1:16) before his anticipated visit, establishing theological foundation for Gentile mission's legitimacy.

**Author and Audience:** Pauline authorship is undisputed. The letter identifies Paul as author (1:1), includes autobiographical details matching Acts and other letters, and exhibits Paul's characteristic theology, vocabulary, and argumentative style. Romans addresses "all God's beloved in Rome" (1:7), a mixed Jewish-Gentile community Paul hadn't founded or visited. He writes to "the Gentiles" (1:13, 11:13), though addressing Jewish interlocutors (2:17, "you who call yourself a Jew") and assuming Hebrew Bible knowledge. The Roman church likely began through Jewish Christians (Pentecost pilgrims, Acts 2:10; business travelers) and grew through Gentile conversions. Claudius expelled Jews from Rome in 49 CE (Suetonius, Claudius 25.4, mentions "Chrestus" disturbances, likely Christ-related conflicts), forcing Jewish Christians like Priscilla and Aquila to depart (Acts 18:2). During their absence (49-54 CE), Gentile Christians led Roman house churches, developing Law-free practices. Jewish Christians' return after 54 CE created tensions: Law observance, dietary practices, Sabbath/Sunday, weak/strong dynamics (chs. 14-15). Paul addresses these tensions while articulating comprehensive gospel theology. Romans 16's extensive greetings mention 26 individuals, including "Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and fellow prisoners... were in Christ before me" (16:7), suggesting Jerusalem or Syrian origin for some Roman Christians. The audience includes "strong" (Gentile Christians comfortable with Law-freedom) and "weak" (Law-observant Jewish Christians), whom Paul seeks to unify around mutual acceptance (14:1-15:13). Paul writes as apostle to Gentiles (11:13, 15:16) establishing his gospel's legitimacy, soliciting Roman support for Spanish mission (15:24), and requesting prayers for Jerusalem journey safety (15:30-32).

**Key Themes:** **Righteousness of God**: God's faithfulness to covenant promises and his making people righteous through faith (1:17, 3:21-26) forms the letter's theological core. **Justification by Faith**: Jews and Gentiles alike are justified (declared righteous) by faith in Christ apart from Torah works (3:21-31, 4:1-25), demonstrated through Abraham's pre-circumcision faith (ch. 4). **Universal Sinfulness**: All humanity—Gentiles (1:18-32) and Jews (2:1-3:20)—stands under sin's power, making all equally dependent on God's grace. **Christ's Atoning Death**: Jesus's death effects propitiation/expiation (3:25, hilastērion, mercy seat), reconciling humanity to God (5:10-11), defeating Sin and Death (5:12-21), providing redemption (3:24). **Life in the Spirit**: Believers live not "according to flesh" but "according to Spirit" (8:1-17), with Spirit as guarantee of resurrection (8:11), interceding for believers (8:26-27), and assuring adoption (8:14-17). **Israel's Future**: Chapters 9-11 address Israel's rejection of Messiah: God's sovereign election (9), Israel's stumbling (10), and future salvation—"all Israel will be saved" (11:26) when "the fullness of the Gentiles" comes in (11:25). Paul insists God hasn't rejected his people (11:1-2). **Practical Righteousness**: Chapters 12-15 present ethics flowing from gospel indicative: transformed mind (12:1-2), love fulfilling Law (13:8-10), mutual acceptance transcending weak/strong divisions (14:1-15:13), body-of-Christ interdependence (12:3-8). **Weak and Strong**: Believers must accept one another despite differences over food laws and sacred days (14:1-15:7), with "strong" bearing with "weak" (15:1).

**Archaeological Relevance:** Romans' mid-1st century CE Roman context receives archaeological corroboration. **Erastus Inscription** (Corinth): Stone pavement reading "Erastus, commissioner of public works [aedile], laid this pavement at his own expense" likely references Romans 16:23's "Erastus, the city treasurer," providing rare NT archaeological connection. The Greek oikonomos (steward/treasurer) corresponds to Latin aedile's financial responsibilities. **Roman House Churches**: Archaeological evidence of 1st century Roman insulae (apartment blocks) and domus (houses) illustrates Romans 16's house church setting (16:5, Prisca and Aquila's house church; 16:14-15, multiple house gatherings). Roman Christians met in homes, not public buildings, until 3rd century. **Claudius Edict (49 CE)**: Suetonius (Claudius 25.4) reports Claudius "expelled Jews from Rome because they were constantly rioting at the instigation of Chrestus," referencing Christ-related conflicts. This expulsion separated Jewish and Gentile Christians (Acts 18:2), contextualizing Romans 14-15's tensions. **Imperial Cult**: Archaeological remains of emperor worship temples, inscriptions, and coinage evidence Romans' religious context. Paul's gospel proclaimed "Jesus is Lord" (10:9) subverting imperial claims ("Caesar is Lord"). Romans 13:1-7's submission to authorities addresses Christian relationship to Rome, neither rebellious nor uncritical. **Travel and Communication**: Roman road system (Via Appia, Via Egnatia), milestones, and courier services enabled Paul's letter delivery from Corinth to Rome via Phoebe (16:1). Archaeological evidence confirms 1st century Mediterranean mobility facilitating Christianity's spread. **Synagogue Architecture**: Ostia synagogue remains (near Rome) illustrate Jewish community structures Paul's audience knew. **Roman Legal System**: Paul's upcoming trial in Jerusalem (Acts 21-26) and Roman citizenship (Acts 22:25-29) reflect legal procedures described in Acts and implied in Romans.

**Structure:** Romans' 16 chapters follow clear theological-ethical progression. **Opening (1:1-17)**: Greeting (1:1-7), thanksgiving and travel plans (1:8-15), thesis statement: "The righteous shall live by faith" (1:16-17). **Part I: Righteousness Revealed (1:18-4:25)**: God's wrath against Gentile idolatry (1:18-32), Jewish hypocrisy condemned (2:1-29), universal sinfulness established (3:1-20), righteousness through faith in Christ's atoning death (3:21-31), Abraham as faith's prototype before circumcision (4:1-25). **Part II: Blessings of Justification (5:1-8:39)**: Peace with God, reconciliation, hope (5:1-11), Christ's obedience reversing Adam's disobedience (5:12-21), dying to Sin through baptism (6:1-14), freedom from Sin's slavery (6:15-23), freedom from Law's condemnation (7:1-25, "wretched man" struggle), life in the Spirit—adoption, intercession, assurance (8:1-39, climaxing "nothing can separate us from God's love"). **Part III: Israel's Place in God's Plan (9:1-11:36)**: God's sovereign election (9:1-29), Israel's stumbling (9:30-10:21), remnant theology (11:1-10), Gentile provocation leads to Israel's full salvation (11:11-32), doxology (11:33-36). **Part IV: Practical Righteousness (12:1-15:13)**: Living sacrifice (12:1-2), body gifts (12:3-8), love practices (12:9-21), submission to authorities (13:1-7), love fulfilling Law (13:8-14), welcoming weak and strong (14:1-15:13). **Conclusion (15:14-16:27)**: Paul's ministry and travel plans (15:14-33), commending Phoebe and greetings (16:1-23), doxology (16:25-27). Romans stands as Paul's most systematic theological exposition, influencing Augustine, Luther, Calvin, and Western theology profoundly.

### Romans Chapter 8

          There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.
For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
For to be carnally minded
is death; but to be spiritually minded
is life and peace.
Because the carnal mind
is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.
But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
And if Christ
be in you, the body
is dead because of sin; but the Spirit
is life because of righteousness.
But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.
For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:
And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with
him, that we may be also glorified together.
For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time
are
 not worthy
to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.
For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected
the same in hope,
Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
And not only
they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption,
to wit, the redemption of our body.
For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
But if we hope for that we see not,
then do we with patience wait for
it.
Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what
is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to
the will of God.
And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to
his purpose.
For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate
to be
 conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
What shall we then say to these things? If God
be for us, who
can be against us?
He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect?
It is
 God that justifieth.
Who
is he that condemneth?
It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.


### Romans Chapter 9

I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,
That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.
For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
Who are Israelites; to whom
pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service
of God, and the promises;
Whose
are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ
came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they
are not all Israel, which are of Israel:
Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham,
are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these
are
 not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.
For this
is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
And not only
this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,
even by our father Isaac;
(For
the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)
It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
What shall we say then?
Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
So then
it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.
For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will
have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.
Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?
Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed
it, Why hast thou made me thus?
Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?
What if God, willing to shew
his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:
And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,
Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?
As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.
And it shall come to pass,
that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye
are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.
Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:
For he will finish the work, and cut
it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.
And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.
What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.
But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.
Wherefore? Because
they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;
As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.


### Romans Chapter 10

Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.
For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
For Christ
is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.
But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down
from above:)
Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)
But what saith it? The word is nigh thee,
even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?
So then faith
cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by
them that are no people,
and by a foolish nation I will anger you.
But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.
But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.

### Romans Chapter 11

I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham,
of the tribe of Benjamin.
God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,
Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to
the image of
 Baal.
Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
And if by grace, then
is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if
it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded
(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.
And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:
Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.
I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but
rather through their fall salvation
is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.
Now if the fall of them
be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:
If by any means I may provoke to emulation
them which are
 my flesh, and might save some of them.
For if the casting away of them
be the reconciling of the world, what
shall the receiving
of them be, but life from the dead?
For if the firstfruit
be holy, the lump
is also
holy: and if the root
be holy, so
are the branches.
And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
For if God spared not the natural branches,
take heed lest he also spare not thee.
Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in
his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.
For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural
branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?
For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
For this
is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.
As concerning the gospel,
they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election,
they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes.
For the gifts and calling of God
are without repentance.
For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:
Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.
O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable
are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?
Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
For of him, and through him, and to him,
are all things: to whom
be glory for ever. Amen.


### Romans Chapter 12

I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is
 your reasonable service.
And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think
of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
So we,
being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy,
let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
Or ministry,
let us wait on
our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;
Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth,
let him do it
 with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.
          Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.
Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.
Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but
rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance
is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.
Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.


### Romans Chapter 13

Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:
For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to
execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.
Wherefore
ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.
Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute
is due;
 custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.
For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if
there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love
is the fulfilling of the law.
And that, knowing the time, that now
it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now
is our salvation nearer than when we believed.
The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.
Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.
But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to
fulfil the lusts
thereof.


### Romans Chapter 14

Him that is weak in the faith receive ye,
but not to doubtful disputations.
For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.
Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.
Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.
One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day
alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
He that regardeth the day, regardeth
it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard
it.
 He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.
For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.
But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
For it is written,
As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in
his
 brother’s way.
I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that
there is
 nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him
it is unclean.
But if thy brother be grieved with
thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.
Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
For he that in these things serveth Christ
is acceptable to God, and approved of men.
Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.
For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed
are
 pure; but
it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.
It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor
any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
Hast thou faith? have
it to thyself before God. Happy
is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because
he eateth
 not of faith: for whatsoever
is not of faith is sin.


### Romans Chapter 15

We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
Let every one of us please
his neighbour for
his
 good to edification.
For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.
For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.
Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:
That ye may with one mind
and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.
Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises
made unto the fathers:
And that the Gentiles might glorify God for
his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.
And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.
And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.
Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.
And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,
That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.
I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.
For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,
Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.
Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation:
But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.
For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;
Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your
company.
But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.
It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.
When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.
And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in
your
 prayers to God for me;
That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which
I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;
That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.
Now the God of peace
be with you all. Amen.

### 2 Corinthians Chapter 6

We then,
as workers together
with him, beseech
you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now
is the accepted time; behold, now
is the day of salvation.)
Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
But in all
things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;
By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and
yet true;
As unknown, and
yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and
yet possessing all things.
O
ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.
Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto
my children,) be ye also enlarged.
Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?
And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in
them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean
thing; and I will receive you,
And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.


### 2 Corinthians Chapter 7

Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.
I speak not
this to condemn
you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with
you.
Great
is my boldness of speech toward you, great
is
 my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.
For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without
were fightings, within
were
 fears.
Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.
For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though
it were but for a season.
Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.
For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea,
what clearing of yourselves, yea,
what indignation, yea,
what fear, yea,
what vehement desire, yea,
what zeal, yea,
what
 revenge! In all
things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.
Wherefore, though I wrote unto you,
I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.
Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.
For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which
I made
 before Titus, is found a truth.
And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all
things.


### 2 Corinthians Chapter 8

Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
For to
their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond
their
 power
they were willing of themselves;
Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and
take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
And
this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.
Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.
Therefore, as ye abound in every
thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and
in all diligence, and
in
 your love to us,
see that ye abound in this grace also.
I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
And herein I give
my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.
Now therefore perform the doing
of it; that as
there was
 a readiness to will, so
there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.
For if there be first a willing mind,
it is accepted according to that a man hath,
and not according to that he hath not.
For
I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:
But by an equality,
that now at this time your abundance
may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be
a supply for your want: that there may be equality:
As it is written, He that
had gathered much had nothing over; and he that
had gathered little had no lack.
But thanks
be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.
For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.
And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;
And not
that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and
declaration of your ready mind:
Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:
Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which
I have in you.
Whether
any do enquire of Titus,
he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren
be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches,
and the glory of Christ.
Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.


### 2 Corinthians Chapter 9

For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.
Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:
Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.
Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as
a matter of bounty, and not as
of covetousness.
But this
I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
Every man according as he purposeth in his heart,
so let him give;
 not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.
And God
is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all
things, may abound to every good work:
(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.
Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for
your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)
Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.
For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;
Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for
your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all
men;
And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.
Thanks
be unto God for his unspeakable gift.


### 2 Corinthians Chapter 10

Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence
am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:
But I beseech
you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
(For the weapons of our warfare
are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)
Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he
is Christ’s, even so
are we Christ’s.
For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:
That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
For
his letters, say they,
are weighty and powerful; but
his bodily presence
is weak, and
his speech contemptible.
Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such
will we be also in deed when we are present.
For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
But we will not boast of things without
our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.
For we stretch not ourselves beyond
our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in
preaching
 the gospel of Christ:
Not boasting of things without
our measure,
that is,
 of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,
To preach the gospel in the
regions beyond you,
and
 not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.
But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.

### 2 Corinthians Chapter 11

Would to God ye could bear with me a little in
my folly: and indeed bear with me.
For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present
you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or
if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with
him.
For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
But though
I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.
Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?
I robbed other churches, taking wages
of them, to do you service.
And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all
things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep
myself.
As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
For such
are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
Therefore
it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.
That which I speak, I speak
it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye
yourselves are wise.
For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour
you, if a man take
of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.
I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.
Are they Hebrews? so
am I. Are they Israelites? so
am
 I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so
am I.
Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I
am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.
Of the Jews five times received I forty
stripes save one.
Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
In journeyings often,
in perils of waters,
in perils of robbers,
in perils by
mine own
 countrymen,
in perils by the heathen,
in perils in the city,
in perils in the wilderness,
in perils in the sea,
in perils among false brethren;
In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.
In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:
And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.


### 2 Corinthians Chapter 12

It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.
For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but
now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me
to be, or
that he heareth of me.
And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
And he said unto me,
My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.
Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except
it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.
Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.
But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
I desired Titus, and with
him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit?
walked we not in the same steps?
Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but
we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and
that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest
there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and
that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.


### 2 Corinthians Chapter 13

This
is the third
time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:
Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.
For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.
Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?
But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.
For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish,
even your perfection.
Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.
Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
Greet one another with an holy kiss.
All the saints salute you.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost,
be with you all. Amen.

**Historical Timeframe:** Galatians' dating depends on identifying its recipients and Paul's visits to Jerusalem. Two main theories exist: **North Galatian Theory** identifies recipients as ethnic Galatians in northern Asia Minor (Ancyra, Pessinus, Tavium), placing composition c. 53-57 CE after Paul's second/third missionary journeys. **South Galatian Theory** (more widely accepted) identifies recipients as churches in southern Galatia (Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe) founded during Paul's first journey (Acts 13-14, c. 47-48 CE), placing composition c. 48-49 CE (before Jerusalem Council, Acts 15) or c. 49-50 CE (shortly after). Early dating (48-49 CE) makes Galatians Paul's earliest letter, written from Syrian Antioch in response to "Judaizers" (Jewish-Christian teachers insisting Gentile converts must be circumcised and keep Torah). Paul's heated tone ("O foolish Galatians!" 3:1; "I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!" 5:12) reflects crisis urgency: Gentile converts were accepting circumcision (5:2-3, 6:12-13), abandoning Paul's Law-free gospel. The letter addresses fundamental questions: Must Gentiles become Jews to follow the Jewish Messiah? What role does Mosaic Law play in Christian life? How are people justified before God? Galatians articulates Paul's mature theology of justification by faith apart from works of Law, predating and anticipating Romans' fuller treatment. The crisis occasioning Galatians involved traveling teachers undermining Paul's authority and gospel, possibly appealing to Jerusalem apostles' authority, prompting Paul's spirited defense (chs. 1-2) and theological argument (chs. 3-4) before ethical application (chs. 5-6).

**Author and Audience:** Pauline authorship is universally accepted. Paul identifies himself (1:1, "Paul an apostle"), includes autobiographical details (1:13-2:14), and exhibits characteristic passionate argumentation. Paul addresses "the churches of Galatia" (1:2), either northern ethnic Galatians (Celts/Gauls who migrated to central Asia Minor in 3rd century BCE) or southern cities in Roman Galatia province. South Galatian theory better explains: Acts narrates Paul founding churches in southern Galatia (Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe, Acts 13:13-14:23), no northern Galatian mission is recorded, and southern cities were on major roads facilitating Judaizer travel. Paul's audience consists of predominantly Gentile converts ("formerly... enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods," 4:8; "you who were Gentiles in the flesh," probably implied in 5:2-3's circumcision discussion) who received the Spirit through hearing with faith (3:2-5), experienced miracles (3:5), and initially welcomed Paul enthusiastically (4:13-15) despite his physical illness. The Galatians now face pressure from "agitators" (1:7, 5:10, 12) teaching circumcision necessity (5:2-3, 6:12-13), Torah observance including festivals and dietary laws (4:10, implied 2:11-14), and questioning Paul's apostolic authority (implied 1:1, 11-12, 2:6-9). These Judaizers likely claimed Jerusalem apostles' authorization, appealing to Jesus's Jewish identity and Torah observance, arguing Paul's Law-free gospel diluted authentic Christianity. Paul counters by asserting his gospel came directly from Christ (1:11-12), defending his apostolic independence while maintaining Jerusalem apostles approved his Gentile mission (2:1-10).

**Key Themes:** **Justification by Faith Apart from Works of Law**: Galatians' theological heart declares people are "justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law" (2:16), repeated three times in one verse for emphasis. Abraham's faith-righteousness predated circumcision (3:6-9), demonstrating justification's faith-basis. Law-works cannot justify because Law brings curse through inability to keep all commandments (3:10-14). **Gospel vs. "Different Gospel"**: Paul pronounces anathema (curse) on anyone—even angels—preaching "a different gospel" (1:6-9), declaring his gospel came by Christ's revelation, not human tradition (1:11-12). The Judaizers' circumcision requirement perverts the gospel (5:2-4). **Freedom in Christ**: Christ freed believers from Law's curse (3:13, 4:5), slavery (4:1-7), and elemental spirits (4:3, 8-9). This freedom isn't license for flesh but loving service (5:13-14). **Life in the Spirit vs. Works of Flesh**: Believers live by Spirit's power (5:16-26), producing fruit (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, 5:22-23) rather than flesh's works (5:19-21). **Abraham's True Children**: Faith, not ethnicity or circumcision, makes one Abraham's seed (3:7-9, 29). The promise to Abraham's "offspring" (singular) refers to Christ (3:16), and those in Christ inherit the promise. **Law's Temporary Role**: Law served as "guardian" (paidagōgos, tutor/custodian) until Christ (3:23-25), revealing sin (3:19) but unable to give life (3:21). Christ's coming ended Law's custodial role. **Paul's Apostolic Authority**: Chapters 1-2 defend Paul's gospel as divinely revealed (1:11-17), independent of Jerusalem apostles (1:18-24), yet approved by them (2:1-10). Paul even opposed Peter's hypocrisy regarding Gentile table fellowship (2:11-14).

**Archaeological Relevance:** Galatians' mid-1st century CE Asia Minor setting receives archaeological corroboration. **South Galatian Cities**: Extensive archaeological work at **Pisidian Antioch** reveals Roman colony with temple of Augustus, aqueduct, and theater; **Iconium** (modern Konya) preserves Roman-era remains; **Lystra** inscriptions confirm Roman colony status; **Derbe** site identified at Kerti Hüyük. These excavations contextualize Acts 13-14's missionary accounts. **Roman Roads**: Via Sebaste connected Pisidian Antioch to Lystra and Derbe, facilitating travel for Paul and Judaizers. Milestones and road stations evidence 1st century transportation infrastructure enabling early Christian mission. **Temple of Augustus** (Ancyra/Ankara, northern Galatia): Preserves Res Gestae Divi Augusti inscription, documenting emperor worship context within which Christians proclaimed "Jesus is Lord" (contrast imperial cult's "Caesar is Lord"). **Synagogue Inscriptions**: Various Asia Minor synagogue remains and Jewish inscriptions evidence diaspora Jewish communities Paul initially addressed before turning to Gentiles (Acts 13:14, 44-46). **Circumcision**: Jewish practice documented in texts and art, contextualizing Galatians' central controversy. Paul's argument that requiring circumcision obligates keeping entire Law (5:3) reflects Jewish understanding. **Roman Citizenship**: Paul's likely Roman citizenship (Acts 22:25-28) and Tarsus origin (Acts 21:39) evidence cultural tensions between Jewish, Greek, and Roman identities navigated in Galatians' argument. **Slavery and Adoption Practices**: Roman legal practices of slavery manumission and adoption illustrate Paul's metaphors: believers freed from slavery (4:1-7), adopted as sons (4:5), receiving inheritance rights (3:29, 4:7).

**Structure:** Galatians' 6 chapters follow classic Greco-Roman letter structure with passionate argumentation. **Opening (1:1-10)**: Salutation emphasizing Paul's divine apostolic commission (1:1-5), rebuke: "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting" (1:6-10), double anathema on false gospel preachers. **Part I: Paul's Gospel and Apostolic Authority (1:11-2:21)**: Gospel received by revelation, not human teaching (1:11-17), limited Jerusalem contact (1:18-24), Jerusalem apostles approved Paul's Gentile mission (2:1-10), Paul opposed Peter's hypocrisy at Antioch (2:11-14), justification by faith thesis stated (2:15-21, "if righteousness were through law, then Christ died for no purpose"). **Part II: Theological Argument from Scripture (3:1-4:31)**: Galatians received Spirit by faith, not Law-works (3:1-5), Abraham justified by faith (3:6-9), Law brings curse, Christ redeemed from curse (3:10-14), promise predates Law by 430 years (3:15-18), Law's temporary custodial role (3:19-25), baptismal unity formula "neither Jew nor Greek... slave nor free... male and female" (3:26-29), adoption as sons/heirs (4:1-7), warning against returning to bondage (4:8-11), personal appeal recalling initial reception (4:12-20), Hagar-Sarah allegory contrasting slavery (Sinai covenant) and freedom (promise covenant, 4:21-31). **Part III: Ethical Exhortation (5:1-6:10)**: Stand firm in freedom (5:1), circumcision obligates keeping entire Law (5:2-12), freedom serves through love (5:13-15), Spirit vs. flesh (5:16-26), burden-bearing and restoring sinners (6:1-6), sowing and reaping (6:7-10). **Conclusion (6:11-18)**: Paul's large handwriting autograph (6:11), final warning against Judaizers' motives (6:12-13), boasting only in Christ's cross (6:14-16), Paul's stigmata (marks of Jesus, 6:17), benediction (6:18). Galatians' passionate tone and sharp rhetoric reflect crisis urgency, making it Christianity's "Magna Carta of spiritual freedom" (Luther).

## 1 Thessalonians

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** 1 Thessalonians is widely considered Paul's earliest surviving letter, dated c. 49-51 CE during his ministry in Corinth (Acts 18:1-18). The letter was written shortly after Paul, Silas, and Timothy established the Thessalonian church during the second missionary journey (Acts 17:1-9), likely only months after their hasty departure due to Jewish opposition. Paul's reference to Timothy's recent return from Thessalonica (3:6) and his own presence in Athens and Corinth (3:1-2) align with the Acts chronology. The Gallio inscription from Delphi, mentioning Gallio's proconsulship of Achaia (51-52 CE), provides a fixed point confirming Paul's Corinthian ministry around this time. This early dating makes 1 Thessalonians one of the first Christian documents, predating the Gospels by approximately 15-20 years. The letter's undisputed Pauline authorship, simple eschatology, and lack of developed church structure support its primitive date.

**Author and Audience:** The letter identifies "Paul, Silvanus [Silas], and Timothy" as senders (1:1), though Paul's first-person singular throughout (2:18, 3:5, 5:27) indicates his primary authorship. The recipients are "the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (1:1). Thessalonica (modern Thessaloniki, Greece) was the capital of the Roman province of Macedonia, a major port on the Via Egnatia (the main east-west highway), and home to perhaps 100,000-200,000 people. Acts 17:1-9 describes how Paul preached in the synagogue for three Sabbaths, converting some Jews and "a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women" (Acts 17:4). The congregation was predominantly Gentile (1:9: "turned to God from idols"), though including Jewish believers. Paul's brief ministry (perhaps only a few weeks to a few months) before being driven out by a riot makes the Thessalonians' rapid spiritual growth remarkable. The "politarchs" (city officials) mentioned in Acts 17:6 were confirmed by inscriptions from Thessalonica's Vardar Gate.

**Key Themes:** **Resurrection Hope**: Paul addresses anxiety about believers who had died before Christ's return (4:13-18), assuring that "the dead in Christ will rise first" and believers will be "caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord." This passage provides the earliest written Christian teaching on resurrection and Parousia. **Sanctification**: Living "to please God" (4:1) involves sexual purity (4:3-8), brotherly love (4:9-10), quiet industry (4:11-12), distinguishing Christians from pagan culture. **Imitation of Christ and Apostles**: The Thessalonians "became imitators of us and of the Lord" (1:6), themselves becoming models for all believers in Macedonia and Achaia (1:7-8). **Suffering and Persecution**: Paul affirms that persecution is expected ("we are destined for this," 3:3-4), connecting Thessalonian suffering to that of Judean churches and ultimately to Christ himself (2:14-16). **Day of the Lord**: Coming "like a thief in the night" (5:2), requiring readiness, sobriety, and faithful living (5:1-11).

**Archaeological Relevance:** **Thessalonica Excavations**: Extensive remains document first-century Thessalonica's prominence. The Roman forum (agora) has been excavated, along with sections of the Via Egnatia running through the city center. The second-century Arch of Galerius replaced an earlier Roman arch, marking the city's importance. **Politarch Inscriptions**: Acts 17:6, 8 refers to "politarchs" (city rulers), a term skeptics once questioned as Luke's error. However, at least 32 inscriptions (19 from Thessalonica itself) confirm "politarch" as the precise title for Macedonian city officials in the Roman period. The most famous, from the Vardar Gate (now in the British Museum), lists six politarchs from Thessalonica, potentially including some who dealt with Paul's opponents. **Jewish Presence**: Inscriptions and archaeological remains confirm a significant Jewish community in Thessalonica, corroborating Acts 17:1's reference to a synagogue. Samareia inscription and other Jewish epitaphs demonstrate continuous Jewish presence from the Hellenistic period through the Roman era. **Economic Activity**: Archaeological evidence of Thessalonica's bustling port and commercial activity illuminates Paul's commendation of "working with your own hands" (4:11) - the congregation's economic context contrasts with idleness some were tempted toward while awaiting Christ's return. **Papyrus Evidence**: Early manuscripts include important witnesses like Papyrus 30 (3rd century, containing portions of 1-2 Thessalonians), demonstrating the letter's early circulation and copying.

**Structure:** **Opening (1:1-10)**: Greeting (1:1), thanksgiving for the Thessalonians' exemplary faith, love, and hope demonstrated in their conversion from idols to serve the living God and await his Son from heaven (1:2-10). **Paul's Ministry Among Them (2:1-3:13)**: Defense of Paul's conduct and motives during his founding visit (2:1-12), thanksgiving for their reception of the gospel despite persecution (2:13-16), Paul's desire to visit again, thwarted by Satan (2:17-20), sending Timothy instead (3:1-5), Timothy's encouraging report (3:6-10), prayer for reunion and love (3:11-13). **Ethical Instructions (4:1-12)**: Exhortation to please God (4:1-2), sexual purity in contrast to pagan lust (4:3-8), brotherly love and productive work (4:9-12). **Eschatological Teaching (4:13-5:11)**: Assurance about believers who have died - they will rise first at Christ's coming (4:13-18), watchfulness for the Day of the Lord that comes like a thief (5:1-11). **Final Exhortations and Closing (5:12-28)**: Respect for leaders (5:12-13), various community instructions (5:14-22), prayer for sanctification (5:23-24), requests for prayer (5:25), holy kiss (5:26), charge to read the letter to all (5:27), benediction (5:28).

## 2 Thessalonians

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** 2 Thessalonians is traditionally dated shortly after 1 Thessalonians, c. 50-51 CE, during Paul's continued ministry in Corinth. However, this letter faces significant scholarly debate regarding authorship and date. Arguments for Pauline authenticity include: explicit claim to Paul's authorship with authenticating signature (3:17), similarities to 1 Thessalonians, and early manuscript attestation. Arguments for pseudonymity cite: dependence on 1 Thessalonians yet contradictory eschatology (imminent vs delayed Parousia), formal tone lacking 1 Thessalonians' warmth, developed apocalyptic scheme (man of lawlessness, restrainer), vocabulary differences, and the signature emphasis (3:17) possibly protesting too much against forgeries. Those accepting Pauline authorship suggest composition weeks or months after 1 Thessalonians, responding to misunderstandings about the Day of the Lord. Those positing pseudonymity date the letter to 70-90 CE, after Jerusalem's fall and during persecution, written by a Pauline disciple addressing later concerns using the apostle's authority. The letter's canonical acceptance was early and widespread, appearing in Marcion's canon (c. 140 CE) and consistently attested in early lists.

**Author and Audience:** The letter names "Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy" as senders (1:1), addressing "the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (1:1) - identical to 1 Thessalonians' opening. The situation addressed differs from the first letter: while 1 Thessalonians confronted grief over deceased believers and watchfulness for Christ's coming, 2 Thessalonians addresses confusion and alarm ("not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed," 2:2) over teaching that "the day of the Lord has already come" (2:2), possibly based on a forged letter claiming Paul's authority (2:2, 3:17). Some Thessalonians had abandoned work, becoming "idle" (3:6-12) - perhaps believing Christ's imminent return made labor pointless. Whether written by Paul shortly after the first letter or by a later disciple, the letter addresses a specific crisis: false teaching about realized eschatology prompting social disruption and theological confusion in the Thessalonian congregation.

**Key Themes:** **Delayed Parousia**: Contrary to claims that the Day of the Lord had arrived, Paul insists certain signs must first occur: "the rebellion" (apostasia, 2:3), the revelation of "the man of lawlessness" (2:3), removal of "what is restraining him" (2:6-7), and the lawless one's destruction by Christ (2:8). This apocalyptic timetable provides assurance that believers have not missed Christ's return. **Divine Justice**: God's righteous judgment will grant "relief" to persecuted believers and "affliction" to afflicters (1:5-10), revealing Christ "in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God" (1:8). This theodicy addresses suffering Christians' need for assurance that justice will prevail. **Restrainer Mystery**: The enigmatic "restraining" force (2:6-7) holding back the man of lawlessness has generated numerous interpretations (Roman Empire, Holy Spirit, angelic power, Paul's mission, law and order), reflecting apocalyptic literature's coded language. **Church Discipline**: Disorderly, idle believers must be warned and, if unrepentant, shunned as discipline ("do not associate with him," 3:14), though treated as brothers, not enemies (3:15). **Work Ethic**: "If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat" (3:10) counters eschatologically-motivated idleness, insisting Christian waiting involves productive labor, not passive dependence.

**Archaeological Relevance:** **Thessalonica Context**: Archaeological evidence for 2 Thessalonians is identical to 1 Thessalonians, as both address the same congregation: politarch inscriptions confirming Acts' accuracy, Jewish synagogue evidence, commercial port remains, and Via Egnatia highway sections. The letter's concern with work ethics finds context in Thessalonica's commercial economy where idleness would burden the Christian community. **Imperial Cult**: First-century inscriptions from Thessalonica document emperor worship and civic religion. Paul's reference to the man of lawlessness "proclaiming himself to be God" and "taking his seat in the temple of God" (2:4) may allude to imperial pretensions (cf. Caligula's attempt to place his statue in Jerusalem's temple, 40 CE) or broader Roman religious claims, providing political-theological critique encoded in apocalyptic language. **Persecution Evidence**: While explicit archaeological evidence for Christian persecution in 50s Thessalonica is lacking, inscriptions documenting imperial loyalty, civic pride in Roman alliance, and Jewish community tensions provide context for hostility toward Christians preaching another king (Acts 17:7). **Manuscript Evidence**: Same early manuscripts as 1 Thessalonians preserve 2 Thessalonians (especially Papyrus 30, 3rd century), with early canonical inclusion in Muratorian Canon, Marcion's list, and patristic citations.

**Structure:** **Opening (1:1-12)**: Greeting (1:1-2), thanksgiving for the Thessalonians' growing faith and love amid persecutions (1:3-4), assurance of God's righteous judgment at Christ's revelation, bringing relief to persecuted believers and punishment to persecutors (1:5-10), prayer for their calling and glorification (1:11-12). **The Day of the Lord (2:1-17)**: Exhortation not to be alarmed by claims that the Day has arrived (2:1-2), signs that must first occur: rebellion, man of lawlessness revealed, restrainer removed (2:3-12), thanksgiving that God chose the Thessalonians for salvation (2:13-14), exhortation to stand firm in apostolic traditions (2:15-17). **Request and Discipline (3:1-15)**: Request for prayer for the gospel's advance (3:1-2), assurance of God's faithfulness and protection from evil (3:3-5), command to keep away from idle brothers (3:6), Paul's example of hard work (3:7-9), rule that the unwilling worker should not eat (3:10-12), instruction not to grow weary in doing good and to discipline the disobedient while treating them as brothers (3:13-15). **Conclusion (3:16-18)**: Prayer for peace (3:16), authenticating signature in Paul's own hand (3:17), benediction (3:18).

## Part 14: Later New Testament Writings

### Historical and Cultural Background: Later New Testament Writings

**Historical Context (Second Generation Christianity: 60-95 CE)**

The Later New Testament period encompasses writings from Christianity's second generation, addressing increasingly organized churches, emerging leadership structures, developing theology, false teaching threats, and persecution realities. Traditional dating places the Prison Epistles (Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon) in Paul's Roman imprisonment (60-62 CE), though some scholars propose Caesarean or Ephesian imprisonment, or pseudonymous authorship (especially Ephesians) from the post-Pauline period (70-90 CE). The Pastoral Epistles (1-2 Timothy, Titus) claim Pauline authorship but face scholarly debate, with critical scholarship often dating them to 80-100 CE as pseudonymous works addressing second-generation concerns using Paul's authority. Hebrews (authorship unknown, written to Jewish Christians, possibly before 70 CE or 80s-90s CE) addresses apostasy threats and interprets Christ through priestly/sacrificial categories. The General Epistles (James, 1-2 Peter, 1-3 John, Jude) address diverse communities facing persecution, false teaching, and moral challenges, with dating ranging from James (possibly 40s-60s CE if by Jesus' brother) through 2 Peter (possibly 80-100 CE). This period witnessed: Jerusalem's destruction (70 CE) removing Christianity's Jewish center; apostolic generation's deaths (Paul c. 64-68 CE, Peter c. 64-68 CE, James 62 CE per Josephus); Neronian persecution (64-68 CE); Domitian's reign (81-96 CE) with possible localized persecutions; and Christianity's transformation from apostolic founding to institutionalized structures, canonical consciousness, and increasingly Gentile identity.

**Geographic Setting**

Later NT writings address churches throughout the Roman Empire's eastern Mediterranean and beyond. The Prison Epistles reference Ephesus (major Pauline center in Asia Minor), Philippi (Macedonia), Colossae (Phrygia, Asia Minor threatened by syncretistic teaching), and Rome (Paul's imprisonment location). The Pastoral Epistles address Ephesus (Timothy's location) and Crete (Titus's mission field), reflecting Paul's alleged travels between imprisonments (disputed historically). Hebrews' destination remains uncertain—possibly Rome (based on "those from Italy send greetings," Heb 13:24), Jerusalem-area Jewish Christians, or Alexandria. James addresses the "twelve tribes in the Dispersion," suggesting diaspora Jewish Christians throughout the Mediterranean. 1 Peter explicitly addresses believers scattered throughout "Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia" (1:1)—regions in Asia Minor experiencing persecution. 2 Peter and Jude address general Christian audiences facing false teaching. The Johannine epistles (1-3 John) likely originate from Ephesus (traditional association with John the Elder/Apostle) addressing Asian churches. By this period, Christianity had spread throughout the empire's urban centers and rural regions, with major concentrations in Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt, Greece, Italy, and possibly Gaul and North Africa according to later tradition. The Jerusalem church's destruction (70 CE) shifted Christianity's center westward to Antioch, Ephesus, Alexandria, and Rome.

**Cultural Context**

Second-generation Christians navigated increasing tensions between Christian identity and Greco-Roman society, developing institutional structures and confronting syncretism. **Household codes** (Haustafel) appear in Ephesians, Colossians, and the Pastorals, addressing Christian family structures (husbands/wives, parents/children, masters/slaves) within Greco-Roman patriarchal contexts, sometimes accommodating, sometimes subverting cultural norms. **Church organization** developed: bishops/overseers (episkopoi), elders (presbyteroi), and deacons (diakonoi) emerged as distinct offices (1 Timothy 3; Titus 1), replacing charismatic leadership with institutional authority. **Widows** received institutional support (1 Timothy 5:3-16). **Women's roles** faced increasing restriction in some contexts (1 Timothy 2:11-15) while maintaining leadership in others (Phoebe, Priscilla). **Sound doctrine** concerns proliferated as the apostolic generation died, requiring written authoritative teachings to combat heresies. **Greco-Roman philosophical influence** appears in cosmic Christology (Colossians), Logos theology (John), and engagement with Greek categories while maintaining Jewish monotheism. **Honor-shame dynamics** continued: persecution brought shame, reinterpreted as sharing Christ's sufferings and securing future honor. **Social stratification** in churches is addressed: rich and poor (James 2:1-7), slaves and masters (Philemon, Ephesians 6:5-9), requiring unity across social boundaries. **Persecution experiences** vary from social marginalization (1 Peter) to martyrdom threats (Hebrews), requiring theological frameworks for suffering.

**Political Context**

The Later NT period witnessed increasing Christian-Roman tensions culminating in persecutions and Christianity's separation from Judaism's legal protections. Nero's persecution (64-68 CE) following Rome's great fire (64 CE) blamed Christians, resulting in Peter and Paul's martyrdoms (traditional dating 64-68 CE). 1 Clement (c. 95-96 CE) references these deaths. Domitian (81-96 CE) is traditionally associated with persecution, though extent is debated—possible emperor cult enforcement, execution of aristocratic Christians (Flavius Clemens, Domitilla), and localized Asian persecutions. 1 Peter addresses suffering "as a Christian" (4:16), suggesting the name itself was criminalized. Pliny the Younger's letter to Trajan (c. 112 CE) confirms Christianity's illegal status and execution of confessing Christians. Christians faced charges of atheism (refusing traditional gods), disloyalty (refusing emperor worship), immorality (misunderstood "love feasts"), and antisocial behavior (separating from civic religion). The NT response varies: Romans 13:1-7 advocates submission to governing authorities; Revelation portrays Rome as Babylon, oppressive beast, and whore, calling for resistance. 1 Peter counsels patient endurance and honorable conduct to shame false accusations (2:12-17). The Jewish Revolt's failure (70 CE) and Bar Kokhba revolt (132-135 CE) further separated Christianity from Judaism politically, removing Christianity's inherited legal status (religio licita) as Christianity became increasingly Gentile and distinct.

**Economic Context**

Economic concerns in Later NT writings reflect maturing churches addressing wealth distribution, support systems, and Christian engagement with commercial life. The Prison Epistles show Paul supported by churches (Philippians' gifts, 4:10-19) and hosting visitors during imprisonment, requiring financial resources. Philemon addresses slavery economically: Onesimus, a runaway slave, possibly owing Philemon financial restitution, is sent back with Paul's plea for forgiveness and reception as brother rather than property—neither abolishing slavery institutionally nor supporting it theologically. The Pastoral Epistles address wealthy church members: avoiding materialism (1 Timothy 6:9-10, "love of money is root of all evil"), being generous (6:17-19), and supporting church leaders financially ("double honor" for elders, 1 Timothy 5:17-18). Institutional widow support required means testing and family responsibility parameters (1 Timothy 5:3-16). James strongly critiques wealth inequality: condemning rich oppressors (5:1-6), warning against favoritism toward wealthy (2:1-7), and emphasizing practical charity as true religion (1:27; 2:14-17). 1 Peter addresses slaves experiencing suffering under harsh masters (2:18-25), providing theological framework. Hebrews references property confiscation during persecution (10:32-34), requiring economic solidarity. The emerging institutional church required funding for clergy, widows, hospitality to traveling ministers, and relief for persecuted believers, necessitating economic organization and patron support while maintaining prophetic critique of wealth.

**Religious Context**

Later NT writings address second-generation challenges: maintaining apostolic teaching amid false teachings, developing institutional structures, articulating Christology, and navigating persecution theologically. **False teaching threats**: Colossians confronts proto-Gnostic syncretism combining Jewish, pagan, and Christian elements (angel worship, asceticism, cosmic powers). The Pastorals combat teachings forbidding marriage, requiring vegetarianism, and denying future resurrection (1 Timothy 4:1-5; 2 Timothy 2:16-18). 2 Peter and Jude address libertine false teachers denying Christ's return and living immorally. 1 John confronts Docetism (denying Christ came in flesh, 4:2-3) and antinomian ethics. **Christological development**: Colossians presents cosmic Christ ("image of invisible God, firstborn of creation," 1:15-20); Hebrews interprets Christ as eternal high priest superseding Levitical priesthood; Johannine literature affirms Christ's deity and incarnation against Docetic denials. **Church structure**: Pastoral Epistles formalize qualifications for bishops/overseers, elders, and deacons (1 Timothy 3; Titus 1), shifting from charismatic to institutional authority. **Canon consciousness**: 2 Peter 3:15-16 references Paul's letters as Scripture, indicating canonical recognition. Jude references 1 Enoch, showing fluid canonical boundaries. **Apostasy concerns**: Hebrews warns against falling away (6:4-8; 10:26-31); 2 Peter and Jude combat scoffers denying Christ's return. **Persecution theology**: 1 Peter reframes suffering as participation in Christ's sufferings (4:12-19); Hebrews encourages perseverance through Christ's high priestly intercession and heavenly reality. **Ethics**: James emphasizes faith-works integration (2:14-26); the Pastorals stress godliness and sound doctrine; 1 John emphasizes love as Christian identity marker (3:11-18; 4:7-21). **Eschatology**: 2 Peter addresses "delay" of parousia (3:3-13), reinterpreting as patience not delay.

## Ephesians

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Ephesians is traditionally dated to Paul's Roman imprisonment (c. 60-62 CE), part of the "Prison Epistles" with Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon (1:1, 3:1, 4:1, 6:20). However, authorship remains debated: traditional view defends Pauline authorship, while many modern scholars propose a Pauline disciple wrote it (c. 80-95 CE) using Paul's theology but adapting it for later church needs. Arguments for pseudonymous authorship include: different vocabulary/style from undisputed Pauline letters (42 hapax legomena), theological development (more cosmic/universal ecclesiology, realized eschatology), literary dependence on Colossians (sharing 1/3 of content), and lack of personal greetings despite Paul's extended Ephesian ministry (Acts 19). Arguments for authenticity include: ancient unanimous attribution, strong manuscript evidence, amanuensis explaining style differences, and theological continuity with Paul's thought. Regardless of authorship, Ephesians addresses established churches, likely as circular letter (earliest manuscripts omit "in Ephesus," 1:1; Paul wouldn't need to introduce himself to Ephesians after 3-year ministry). The letter synthesizes Paul's theology, emphasizing church unity, cosmic Christology, and Christian ethics flowing from salvation.

**Author and Audience:** Traditional attribution to Paul is contested. The letter claims Pauline authorship (1:1, 3:1) but lacks personal touches expected after Paul's 3-year Ephesian ministry (Acts 19:8-10, 20:31). The address "to the saints in Ephesus" is absent from earliest manuscripts (P46, Codex Vaticanus, Codex Sinaiticus), suggesting circular letter to Asia Minor churches. Recipients are Gentile Christians ("you Gentiles," 2:11, 3:1; formerly "dead in trespasses and sins," 2:1-3) now incorporated into God's household with Jewish believers (2:11-22). The audience knows Paul's ministry reputation (3:2-4) but may not know him personally, explaining lack of greetings. Ephesians addresses mature Christians needing ecclesiological teaching: church as Christ's body (1:22-23, 4:15-16), unity amid diversity (4:1-16), and cosmic battle requiring spiritual armor (6:10-20). The letter's elevated, liturgical style suggests use in worship contexts, teaching new converts about their identity in Christ and ethical implications.

**Key Themes:** **Salvation in Christ**: Believers chosen before foundation (1:4), predestined for adoption (1:5), redeemed through Christ's blood (1:7), sealed with the Spirit (1:13), saved by grace through faith (2:8-9), created for good works (2:10). **Church as Christ's Body**: Ecclesiology emphasizes church as universal body with Christ as head (1:22-23), growing into Christ (4:15-16), requiring unity (4:3-6). **Unity of Jew and Gentile**: Christ abolished dividing wall between Jew and Gentile (2:14-16), creating "one new man" (2:15), both accessing Father through one Spirit (2:18). **Cosmic Christology**: Christ fills all in all (1:23), sits above all rule and authority (1:20-21), unites all things under his headship (1:10). **Walk Worthy**: Ethical exhortations emphasize "walking" worthy of calling (4:1), in love (5:2), as children of light (5:8), wisely (5:15). **Spiritual Warfare**: Believers battle not flesh and blood but spiritual forces, requiring God's armor (6:10-20). **Household Codes**: Mutual submission structures marriages (5:21-33), families (6:1-4), and master-slave relations (6:5-9).

**Archaeological Relevance:** **Ephesus Excavations**: Extensive remains include Temple of Artemis site, theater (Acts 19:29), library of Celsus, agora, and harbor street, contextualizing Ephesians' original audience. Paul's 3-year ministry (Acts 19) established Ephesus as mission center. **Artemis Cult**: Archaeological evidence of Diana/Artemis worship (one of Seven Wonders) contextualizes Ephesians' spiritual warfare imagery (6:10-20) and rejection of idolatry. **Imperial Cult**: Temples and inscriptions evidencing emperor worship in Ephesus contrast with Ephesians' Christ as supreme over all powers (1:20-21). **Manumission Inscriptions**: Evidence of slavery practices illuminates Ephesians 6:5-9's household codes and spiritual freedom metaphors.

**Structure:** **Doctrinal Section (1-3)**: Blessings in Christ (1:3-14), prayer for wisdom (1:15-23), salvation by grace (2:1-10), Jew-Gentile unity (2:11-22), Paul's ministry to Gentiles (3:1-13), prayer for strengthening (3:14-21). **Ethical Section (4-6)**: Unity and gifts (4:1-16), new life (4:17-32), love and purity (5:1-20), household codes (5:21-6:9), spiritual warfare (6:10-20), conclusion (6:21-24). Ephesians presents high Pauline theology with practical application for church life.

## Philippians

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Philippians is dated to Paul's imprisonment, debated between Ephesian (c. 54-55 CE), Caesarean (58-60 CE), or Roman (60-62 CE) imprisonment. Most scholars favor Roman imprisonment based on: references to "whole imperial guard" (praetorium, 1:13), "Caesar's household" (4:22), developed theological reflection, and proximity to death (1:20-26, 2:17). However, Ephesian imprisonment advocates note: frequent communication implied (4:18, suggesting geographic proximity), threat of imminent death (1:20-23, less likely during Roman house arrest), and Timothy's anticipated travel (2:19-24). The letter responds to Epaphroditus's visit bringing financial support (4:10-20), his illness and recovery (2:25-30), and reports of church challenges: external opposition (1:27-30), internal disunity (2:1-4, 4:2-3), and Judaizer infiltration (3:2-11). Paul writes from chains (1:7, 13-14, 17) with uncertain outcome, expressing joy (16 times) despite circumstances, encouraging unity, and warning against legalistic teachers.

**Author and Audience:** Pauline authorship is undisputed. Paul and Timothy send greetings (1:1) to "all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons" (1:1). Philippi, a Roman colony in Macedonia (Acts 16:12), was Paul's first European convert community (c. 49-50 CE), including Lydia the purple merchant, the Philippian jailer, and others (Acts 16:11-40). The church demonstrated exceptional generosity, supporting Paul's mission multiple times (4:15-16) and sending Epaphroditus with gifts (4:18). Paul addresses a beloved, supportive church facing persecution (1:27-30), internal conflict between Euodia and Syntyche (4:2-3), and external threat from "dogs... evil workers... mutilators" (3:2, likely Judaizers). The letter's warm, personal tone contrasts with Galatians' severity, reflecting Paul's affectionate relationship with Philippians.

**Key Themes:** **Joy in Suffering**: Despite imprisonment and possible death, Paul exhorts "rejoice" (1:18, 2:18, 3:1, 4:4). Joy transcends circumstances, rooted in Christ's presence and gospel advance (1:18-26). **Christ Hymn**: Philippians 2:6-11 presents Christ's self-emptying (kenosis): though in God's form, he emptied himself, taking servant form, humbling himself to death, therefore God exalted him, giving him the name above every name. This hymn grounds Christian humility and unity. **Imitation of Christ**: Believers should have Christ's mindset (2:5), Paul's example (3:17, 4:9), Timothy's selflessness (2:19-24), and Epaphroditus's sacrificial service (2:25-30). **Unity and Humility**: Paul pleads for same mind, love, accord (2:2), doing nothing from selfish ambition (2:3), considering others (2:4). **Righteousness Through Faith**: Paul renounces former confidence in flesh (3:4-6: circumcised, Pharisee, Law-zealous), counting all as loss for Christ (3:7-8), pursuing righteousness through faith not Law (3:9). **Press Toward the Goal**: Christian life is forward-looking race (3:12-14), not static achievement but pressing toward upward call. **Contentment**: Paul learned contentment in all circumstances (4:11-13), able to do all things through Christ strengthening him (4:13).

**Archaeological Relevance:** **Philippi Excavations**: Extensive remains include Roman forum, Via Egnatia road, theater, and prison (traditional site where Paul/Silas were imprisoned, Acts 16:23-24). The city's Roman colony status (Acts 16:12) is confirmed archaeologically. **Purple Trade**: Inscriptions evidence purple-dye industry (Lydia's occupation, Acts 16:14). **Praetorian Guard**: References to praetorium (1:13) and Caesar's household (4:22) fit Roman imperial context, though could refer to provincial governors' headquarters. **Roman Citizenship**: Philippi's Roman colony status meant many inhabitants held citizenship, contextualizing Acts 16:37-39's appeal to citizen rights and Philippians' engagement with Roman imperial cult (Paul's "Lord" language subverts Caesar).

**Structure:** **Opening (1:1-11)**: Greeting (1:1-2), thanksgiving for partnership (1:3-8), prayer for love and discernment (1:9-11). **Paul's Circumstances (1:12-26)**: Gospel advances despite chains (1:12-18), life or death both gain (1:19-26). **Exhortations (1:27-2:18)**: Stand firm (1:27-30), unity and humility (2:1-4), Christ hymn (2:5-11), work out salvation (2:12-18). **Travel Plans (2:19-30)**: Timothy's anticipated visit (2:19-24), Epaphroditus's return (2:25-30). **Warning and Testimony (3:1-21)**: Beware dogs/evil workers (3:2-3), Paul's former credentials now loss (3:4-11), press toward goal (3:12-16), beware enemies of cross (3:17-21). **Final Exhortations (4:1-9)**: Stand firm (4:1), Euodia/Syntyche reconciliation (4:2-3), rejoice always (4:4-7), think on excellent things (4:8-9). **Thanksgiving (4:10-20)**: Gratitude for support, contentment learned (4:10-13), generous partnership praised (4:14-20). **Closing (4:21-23)**: Greetings, benediction. Philippians radiates joy and partnership despite adversity.

### Philippians Chapter 3

Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed
is not grievous, but for you
it is
 safe.
Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel,
of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.
But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
Yea doubtless, and I count all things
but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them
but dung, that I may win Christ,
And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;
If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but
this
 one thing
I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.
(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping,
that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:
Whose end
is destruction, whose God
is their belly, and
whose glory
is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)
For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.


### Philippians Chapter 4

Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord,
my dearly beloved.
I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and
with other my fellowlabourers, whose names
are in the book of life.
Rejoice in the Lord alway:
and again I say, Rejoice.
Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord
is at hand.
Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things
are honest, whatsoever things
are just, whatsoever things
are pure, whatsoever things
are lovely, whatsoever things
are of good report; if
there be any virtue, and if
there be any praise, think on these things.
Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am,
therewith to be content.
I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.
Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things
which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
Now unto God and our Father
be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.
All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
be with you all. Amen.

## Colossians

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Colossians is traditionally dated to Paul's Roman imprisonment (c. 60-62 CE), though some scholars debate Ephesian imprisonment (54-55 CE) or pseudonymous authorship (70-80 CE). Arguments for Pauline authorship include: personal references to Paul's imprisonment (4:3, 10, 18), connection to Philemon (Onesimus and Archippus mentioned in both), Timothy as co-sender (1:1), and similarities to undisputed Pauline letters. Arguments for pseudonymity cite: developed Christology, cosmic emphasis, realized eschatology, household codes, and linguistic differences from undisputed letters. The letter addresses a specific crisis in Colossae involving syncretistic teachings combining Jewish practices, angelic worship, and proto-Gnostic elements (2:8-23), suggesting composition during a period when such philosophies threatened early Christian communities.

**Author and Audience:** The letter claims authorship by "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother" (1:1), addressed "to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae" (1:2). Colossae was a city in the Lycus River valley of Phrygia (southwestern Asia Minor), about 100 miles east of Ephesus. By the first century, Colossae had declined from earlier prominence, overshadowed by nearby Laodicea and Hierapolis (4:13). Paul had apparently not personally visited Colossae (2:1), but the church was founded through his ministry influence, likely by Epaphras (1:7, 4:12-13). The congregation included both Jewish and Gentile believers (1:27, 2:11-13, 3:11). Archaeological evidence shows Colossae was destroyed by earthquake c. 60-64 CE and never fully rebuilt, making early dating more plausible if recipients needed to receive the letter.

**Key Themes:** **Christ's Cosmic Supremacy**: The magnificent Christ hymn (1:15-20) declares Jesus as "image of the invisible God, firstborn of all creation," through whom "all things were created" and in whom "all things hold together" - a direct refutation of any teaching that would subordinate Christ to angelic intermediaries or cosmic powers. **Fullness in Christ**: Against syncretistic philosophies requiring additional spiritual practices, Paul insists believers have been "brought to fullness" in Christ (2:9-10), who is "the fullness of the Deity in bodily form." **New Humanity**: The gospel creates a renewed humanity where "there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all" (3:11). **Mystery Revealed**: The "mystery hidden for ages" is now revealed: "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (1:26-27), extending salvation to Gentiles. **Victory Over Powers**: Through the cross, Christ "disarmed the powers and authorities" and "made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them" (2:15), establishing his sovereignty over all spiritual forces.

**Archaeological Relevance:** **Colossae Excavations**: Unlike nearby Laodicea and Hierapolis, Colossae (modern Honaz, Turkey) has never been systematically excavated. Surface surveys identify the ancient site on a mound near the Lycus River, with visible remains including a theater and necropolis. The lack of excavation ironically confirms the city's decline after the earthquake, never achieving the prominence that would attract later building or modern archaeological attention. **Laodicea and Hierapolis**: Extensive excavations at these nearby cities mentioned in Colossians (4:13, 15-16) provide cultural context. Laodicea, seven miles west, was a wealthy banking center (cf. Rev 3:17) with a medical school famous for eye ointment. The Plutonium (gate to the underworld) at Hierapolis, ten miles north, attracted worshippers of Cybele and Apollo, illustrating the syncretistic religious environment. The three cities formed a close cluster of Christian communities sharing apostolic letters. **Lycus Valley Inscriptions**: Numerous inscriptions from the region document mystery cults, angelic veneration, and Jewish communities, corroborating the religious milieu Paul addresses. Jewish inscriptions confirm significant Jewish presence in Phrygia (cf. Acts 2:10), explaining Jewish elements in the Colossian heresy. **Papyrus Evidence**: No early manuscripts of Colossians alone survive, but it appears in major codices (Sinaiticus, Vaticanus, Alexandrinus, 4th-5th centuries) as part of the Pauline corpus, demonstrating early canonical acceptance.

**Structure:** **Opening (1:1-14)**: Greeting (1:1-2), thanksgiving for the Colossians' faith and love (1:3-8), prayer for spiritual wisdom and fruitful living (1:9-14). **Doctrinal Section (1:15-2:23)**: Christ hymn asserting his supremacy over all creation and reconciliation (1:15-23), Paul's ministry to reveal the mystery of Christ in Gentiles (1:24-2:5), warning against deceptive philosophy and human traditions (2:6-23) including regulations about food, festivals, and worship of angels. **Ethical Section (3:1-4:6)**: Seeking things above (3:1-4), putting to death earthly nature and sins of the old self (3:5-11), putting on virtues of the new self (3:12-17), household code for wives/husbands, children/parents, slaves/masters (3:18-4:1), prayer and evangelistic wisdom (4:2-6). **Conclusion (4:7-18)**: Commendation of Tychicus and Onesimus (4:7-9), greetings from Paul's companions (4:10-14), instructions regarding letter circulation and Laodicean letter (4:15-17), personal greeting in Paul's hand (4:18).

### Colossians Chapter 1

Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus
our brother,
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace
be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love
which ye have to all the saints,
For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;
Which is come unto you, as
it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as
it doth also in you, since the day ye heard
of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:
As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;
Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
For this cause we also, since the day we heard
it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;
Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated
us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
In whom we have redemption through his blood,
even the forgiveness of sins:
Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether
they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all
things he might have the preeminence.
For it pleased
the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;
And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him,
I say, whether
they be things in earth, or things in heaven.
And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in
your
 mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:
If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and
be
 not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard,
and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;
Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church:
Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;
Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:
To whom God would make known what
is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:
Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.


### Colossians Chapter 2

For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and
for them at Laodicea, and
for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;
In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.
As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord,
so walk ye in him:
Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.
For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:
In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:
Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with
him
 through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.
And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;
Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath
days:
Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body
is of Christ.
Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.
Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,
(Touch not; taste not; handle not;
Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?
Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.


### Colossians Chapter 3

If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
When Christ,
who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:
For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:
In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.
But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;
And have put on the new
man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:
Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond
nor free: but Christ
is all, and in all.
Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also
do ye.
And above all these things
put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.
And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
And whatsoever ye do in word or deed,
do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.
Husbands, love
your wives, and be not bitter against them.
Children, obey
your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.
Fathers, provoke not your children
to anger, lest they be discouraged.
Servants, obey in all things
your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:
And whatsoever ye do, do
it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.


### Colossians Chapter 4

Masters, give unto
your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.
Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;
Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:
That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.
Let your speech
be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.
All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you,
who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:
Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;
With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is
one
 of you. They shall make known unto you all things which
are done
 here.
Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)
And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only
are my fellow workers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.
Epaphras, who is
one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.
For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them
that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.
Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.
Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.
And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the
epistle
 from Laodicea.
And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.
The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace
be with you. Amen.

### 1 Timothy Chapter 1

Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ,
which is our hope;
Unto Timothy,
my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy,
and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith:
so do.
Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and
of a good conscience, and
of faith unfeigned:
From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
But we know that the law
is good, if a man use it lawfully;
Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did
it ignorantly in unbelief.
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
This
is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God,
be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;
Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:
Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.


### 1 Timothy Chapter 2

I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions,
and giving of thanks, be made for all men;
For kings, and
for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.
For this
is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
For
there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ,
and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.
I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.
In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;
But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.
For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.
Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

## Hebrews

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Hebrews is dated to 60s-90s CE, before or after Jerusalem's Temple destruction (70 CE). Arguments for pre-70 dating include: present-tense references to temple sacrifices (7:27-28, 8:3-5, 9:6-9, 10:1-3, 13:10-11) suggest ongoing temple cult, though these could be literary present describing Mosaic system; no explicit mention of Temple destruction, though argument from silence is weak. Arguments for post-70 dating include: theological sophistication suggesting later development, awareness of Paul's legacy (implied in 13:23's Timothy reference), and addressing second-generation Christians facing persecution and apostasy (2:3, 10:32-34, 13:7). Most scholars favor 65-85 CE, after Paul's death but addressing communities he influenced. The letter addresses Jewish Christians (or Gentile Christians deeply versed in Hebrew Bible) facing pressure to apostatize—either returning to Judaism or abandoning faith entirely amid persecution. The audience has "endured a hard struggle with sufferings" (10:32), experienced property confiscation (10:34), and needs encouragement not to "shrink back" (10:38-39).

**Author and Audience:** Authorship is anonymous; the text never identifies its author. Early church proposed various candidates: Paul (Eastern church tradition), Barnabas (Tertullian), Apollos (Luther, based on Acts 18:24's "eloquent man, competent in Scriptures"), Priscilla (modern suggestion), or unknown author. Pauline authorship is unlikely: Hebrews' elegant Greek style differs from Paul's, theology (high priest Christology, Melchizedek typology, lack of justification-by-faith language) diverges, and 2:3's statement "attested to us by those who heard" places author among second-generation Christians, not apostolic eyewitnesses. Origen famously concluded "who wrote Hebrews, God knows." The audience consists of Jewish Christians (or Gentile God-fearers) deeply familiar with Septuagint, Levitical cult, and typological interpretation. They face persecution (10:32-34, 12:4), temptation to apostatize (2:1-3, 3:12-14, 6:4-8, 10:26-31), and need encouragement to "hold fast" confession (4:14, 10:23). References to "leaders" who spoke God's word (13:7), Timothy (13:23), and greetings from "those from Italy" (13:24) suggest possible Roman destination, though this remains speculative.

**Key Themes:** **Superiority of Christ**: Hebrews systematically demonstrates Christ's supremacy over angels (1:4-14, 2:5-18), Moses (3:1-6), Joshua (4:8), Aaronic priesthood (5:1-10, 7:1-28), Levitical sacrifices (9:1-10:18), establishing Christianity's fulfillment of Judaism. **High Priest Christology**: Jesus is "merciful and faithful high priest" (2:17) after Melchizedek's order (5:6, 10; 6:20; 7:1-28), offering himself as sacrifice (7:27, 9:12-14), entering heavenly sanctuary (9:11-12, 24), making perfect atonement (10:10, 14), and interceding eternally (7:25). **New Covenant**: Christ mediates "new covenant" (8:6-13, quoting Jeremiah 31:31-34), superior to old covenant, making first obsolete (8:13). **Faith and Perseverance**: Chapter 11's "hall of faith" illustrates faithful endurance; believers must "hold fast" (3:6, 14; 4:14; 10:23) and not "shrink back" (10:38-39). **Warning Passages**: Five severe warnings against apostasy (2:1-4; 3:7-4:13; 5:11-6:12; 10:26-31; 12:25-29) address danger of falling away after enlightenment. **Pilgrimage and Rest**: Believers seek heavenly homeland (11:13-16, 13:14), Sabbath rest (4:1-11), and Mt. Zion (12:22-24). **Suffering and Discipline**: God disciplines children (12:4-11); believers share Christ's sufferings (13:12-13), following his example (12:1-3).

**Archaeological Relevance:** **Temple Cult**: Hebrews' detailed sacrificial system descriptions (9:1-10, 13:11) reflect Second Temple practices documented in archaeology: altar remains, priestly garments, ritual vessels. The **Qumran scrolls** evidence Melchizedek speculation (11QMelch), contextualizing Hebrews 7's unique Christology. **Day of Atonement**: Hebrews 9-10's atonement theology references Yom Kippur practices described in Leviticus 16, central to Second Temple Judaism. **Persecution**: References to suffering (10:32-34, property confiscation) match Roman persecution patterns evidenced in historical sources (Tacitus, Suetonius, Pliny). **Heavenly Tabernacle**: Hebrews' contrast between earthly and heavenly sanctuaries (8:1-5, 9:11-12, 24) reflects Jewish apocalyptic thinking found in Dead Sea Scrolls and Philo.

**Structure:** **Christ's Superiority (1:1-10:18)**: Superior to angels (1-2), Moses (3:1-6), rest giver (3:7-4:13), Aaronic priesthood (4:14-7:28), old covenant (8:1-13), Levitical sacrifices (9:1-10:18). **Exhortations to Faith (10:19-13:25)**: Draw near confidently (10:19-25), warning against apostasy (10:26-39), faith examples (11:1-40), Jesus as faith's pioneer (12:1-3), endure discipline (12:4-17), Mt. Zion vision (12:18-29), practical exhortations (13:1-19), benediction (13:20-25). Hebrews' sermonic style blends exposition and exhortation, presenting sophisticated typological interpretation of Hebrew Bible.

### Hebrews Chapter 11

Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
For by it the elders obtained a good report.
Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.
By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
But without faith
it is impossible to please
him:
 for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and
that
 he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as
in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker
is God.
Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.
Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead,
so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of
them, and embraced
them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
And truly, if they had been mindful of that
country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
But now they desire a better
country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.
By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten
son,
Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
Accounting that God
was able to raise
him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped,
leaning upon the top of his staff.
By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw
he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.
By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;
Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.
By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry
land:
 which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.
By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.
By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.
And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and
of Barak, and
of Samson, and
of Jephthae;
of David also, and Samuel, and
of the prophets:
Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
And others had trial of
cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and
in mountains, and
in dens and caves of the earth.
And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:
God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.


### Hebrews Chapter 12

Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of
our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.
Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.
And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:
For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?
But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected
us,
 and we gave
them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?
For they verily for a few days chastened
us after their own pleasure; but he for
our profit, that
we might be partakers of his holiness.
Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.
Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;
And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.
Follow peace with all
men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:
Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble
you, and thereby many be defiled;
Lest there
be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.
For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.
For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words;
which
 voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:
(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:
And so terrible was the sight,
that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)
But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than
that of Abel.
See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more
shall not we
escape,
 if we turn away from him that
speaketh from heaven:
Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.
And this
word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:
For our God
is a consuming fire.


### Hebrews Chapter 13

Let brotherly love continue.
Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them;
and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.
Marriage
is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
Let your conversation
be without covetousness;
and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
So that we may boldly say, The Lord
is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of
their conversation.
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For
it is
 a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.
We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.
For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.
Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.
Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of
our lips giving thanks to his name.
But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that
is unprofitable for you.
Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.
But I beseech
you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom
be
 glory for ever and ever. Amen.
And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.
Know ye that
our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.
Grace
be with you all. Amen.

## James

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** James' dating is debated between early (45-50 CE, making it earliest NT document) and late (80-100 CE, pseudonymous work). Early dating arguments include: primitive Christology (Jesus mentioned only twice, 1:1, 2:1), Jewish character (synagogue for assembly, 2:2), no reference to Gentile controversy (suggesting pre-Acts 15 Jerusalem Council), and James the Just's martyrdom (c. 62 CE, Josephus Antiquities 20.200) as terminus ante quem. Late dating arguments propose: literary relationship with Paul's letters (seemingly responding to misunderstood Pauline theology, 2:14-26), sophisticated Greek style, and developed church structure. Most scholars favor 60-100 CE for a Jewish-Christian document addressing practical piety and ethical living.

**Author and Audience:** "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ" (1:1) traditionally identifies James the Just, Jesus's brother (Matthew 13:55, Mark 6:3, Galatians 1:19), Jerusalem church leader (Acts 15, 21:18, Galatians 2:9-12), and martyr (62 CE). However, excellent Greek, Hellenistic rhetorical style, and lack of Jesus-family references raise questions about direct authorship versus later composition in James's name/tradition. The audience is "the twelve tribes in the Dispersion" (1:1), Jewish Christians scattered throughout Mediterranean, facing trials, economic oppression, and temptation toward nominal faith without works.

**Key Themes:** **Faith and Works**: James's central thesis declares "faith apart from works is dead" (2:26), using Abraham and Rahab as examples (2:21-25). This seemingly contradicts Paul's "justification by faith" but addresses different concerns: Paul combats works-righteousness requiring Torah observance for salvation; James combats dead orthodoxy lacking ethical fruit. **Trials and Temptation**: Trials test faith, producing steadfastness (1:2-4); temptations arise from inner desires, not God (1:13-15). **Wisdom from Above**: True wisdom is "pure, peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy" (3:17) versus earthly, jealous, selfish wisdom (3:14-16). **Taming the Tongue**: The tongue's power for blessing or cursing requires control (3:1-12). **Rich and Poor**: James champions the poor, condemning rich oppressors (2:1-7, 5:1-6), forbidding partiality (2:1-13). **Prayer**: Believers should pray in faith (1:5-8, 5:13-18), with Elijah as example (5:17-18).

**Archaeological Relevance:** **Synagogue Architecture**: James 2:2's "synagogue" (Greek synagōgē for Christian assembly) reflects Jewish-Christian continuity; archaeological synagogue remains contextualize early church worship practices. **Economic Oppression**: James 5:1-6's condemnation of wealthy landowners exploiting laborers reflects 1st century Palestinian economic conditions documented in historical sources. **Diaspora Judaism**: James's addressees ("twelve tribes in Dispersion") inhabited communities evidenced archaeologically throughout Mediterranean—synagogues, Jewish inscriptions, ritual baths.

**Structure:** James lacks linear argument, presenting wisdom sayings and exhortations. **Opening (1:1)**: Greeting. **Trials, Wisdom, Temptation (1:2-27)**: Joy in trials (1:2-4), ask wisdom (1:5-8), rich-poor reversal (1:9-11), temptation's source (1:12-18), quick to hear, slow to speak (1:19-27). **Partiality and Faith-Works (2:1-26)**: No favoritism to rich (2:1-13), faith without works dead (2:14-26). **Taming the Tongue (3:1-12)**: Tongue's destructive power. **Wisdom and Conflict (3:13-4:12)**: True wisdom (3:13-18), worldly desires cause conflicts (4:1-3), friendship with world is enmity with God (4:4-10), judging others (4:11-12). **Wealth and Planning (4:13-5:6)**: Presumptuous planning (4:13-17), rich warned (5:1-6). **Patience and Prayer (5:7-20)**: Patient endurance (5:7-11), oath-taking (5:12), prayer and anointing (5:13-18), restoring wanderers (5:19-20). James' practical wisdom addresses Christian living with Jewish ethical tradition.

### James Chapter 1

James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
Knowing
this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
But let patience have
her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all
men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
A double minded man
is unstable in all his ways.
Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
Blessed
is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
Do not err, my beloved brethren.
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion
is vain.
Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,
and to keep himself unspotted from the world.


### James Chapter 2

My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the Lord
 of glory, with respect of persons.
For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
point, he is guilty of all.
For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
What
doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what
doth it profit?
Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent
them out another way?
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.


### James Chapter 3

My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same
is a perfect man,
and able also to bridle the whole body.
Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.
Behold also the ships, which though
they be so great, and
are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.
Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
And the tongue
is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:
But the tongue can no man tame;
it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.
Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet
water
 and bitter?
Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so
can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
Who
is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
This wisdom descendeth not from above, but
is earthly, sensual, devilish.
For where envying and strife
is, there
is confusion and every evil work.
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle,
and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.


### James Chapter 4

From whence
come wars and fightings among you?
come they
 not hence,
even of your lusts that war in your members?
Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.
Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume
it upon your lusts.
Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse
your
 hands,
ye sinners; and purify
your hearts,
ye double minded.
Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and
your joy to heaviness.
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of
his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?
Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:
Whereas ye know not what
shall be on the morrow. For what
is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
For that ye
ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth
it not, to him it is sin.


### James Chapter 5

Go to now,
ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon
you.
Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.
Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.
Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.
Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.
Ye have condemned
and killed the just;
and he doth not resist you.
Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.
Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.
Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.
Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.
Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.
But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and
your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.
Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.
Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.
Confess
your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.
And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;
Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.

## Part 15: Apocalyptic Vision

### Historical and Cultural Background: Apocalyptic Vision

**Historical Context (Revelation: 90-96 CE, possibly earlier)**

Revelation, the New Testament's only fully apocalyptic book, addresses churches facing persecution, imperial cult pressures, and internal compromise during the late first century. Traditional dating places Revelation during Emperor Domitian's reign (81-96 CE), specifically around 95-96 CE, based on early church testimony (Irenaeus, Against Heresies 5.30.3, c. 180 CE) and internal evidence of persecution and emperor cult enforcement. Alternative dating proposes Nero's reign (54-68 CE), shortly after his persecution (64 CE), based on references to the temple (still standing, Rev 11:1-2) and cryptic "number of the beast" (666) possibly representing Nero Caesar in Hebrew gematria. Most scholars favor Domitianic dating given Revelation's developed Christology, assuming Christian presence in Asia Minor, and evidence of emperor cult pressures rather than systematic persecution. Historical context includes: Roman emperor worship intensifying, particularly in Asia Minor's imperial cult centers; economic pressure on Christians refusing cult participation (marketplace exclusion, Rev 13:16-17); sporadic local persecutions rather than empire-wide campaigns; wealthy urban churches (Laodicea, Sardis) facing compromise temptations; and apocalyptic expectations amid Roman imperial power's apparent invincibility. Archaeological evidence includes: seven churches' cities identified and excavated (Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea); imperial cult temples and altars throughout Asia Minor; Domitian coinage promoting emperor divinity; Pergamum's altar to Zeus ("Satan's throne," Rev 2:13); and Ephesus's massive Artemis temple. External sources confirm conditions: Pliny's letters (c. 112 CE) describe Christian persecution for refusing emperor worship; Suetonius and Dio Cassius record Domitian's self-deification demands; and archaeological remains show imperial cult's pervasiveness in Asia Minor's commercial and civic life.

**Geographic Setting**

Revelation addresses seven literal churches in the Roman province of Asia (western modern Turkey) while symbolically encompassing universal church: **Ephesus** (major port, commercial center, Artemis temple), **Smyrna** (modern Izmir, suffering persecution, Jewish-Christian tensions), **Pergamum** (provincial capital, imperial cult center, Zeus altar/"Satan's throne"), **Thyatira** (trade guilds, Lydia's hometown, syncretism threats), **Sardis** (former Lydian capital, wealthy, complacent), **Philadelphia** (small faithful community, earthquake-prone region), and **Laodicea** (banking center, textile production, tepid spirituality). John writes from **Patmos**, a small Aegean island used for political exile, where he received visions "on the Lord's Day" (1:10). Revelation's symbolic geography includes **Jerusalem** (heavenly city, New Jerusalem descending, chs. 21-22), **Babylon** (Rome coded as oppressive empire, ch. 18), **Egypt and Sodom** (symbolizing oppression and immorality, 11:8), and cosmic realms (heaven's throne room, chs. 4-5; abyss, 9:1; lake of fire, 20:14-15). The book's recipients were real communities facing specific challenges: Ephesus contending with Nicolaitans, Pergamum with Balaam's teaching, Thyatira with Jezebel prophetess, representing concrete historical situations, not merely symbolic. Archaeological remains of these seven cities confirm their first-century prominence, economic significance, and religious pluralism, validating Revelation's geographical specificity while its apocalyptic symbolism transcends particular locations to address universal conflict between God's kingdom and earthly empires.

**Cultural Context**

Revelation's cultural world blended Jewish apocalyptic tradition with Greco-Roman imperial ideology, creating stark alternatives: worship Christ or Caesar. **Imperial cult** permeated Asia Minor's civic life: temples, altars, festivals, oaths, and commercial transactions honored emperors as divine, requiring participation for social inclusion. Refusal meant economic exclusion (Rev 13:16-17, mark of the beast), social ostracism, and legal vulnerability. **Trade guilds** (collegia) dominated urban economic life, requiring attendance at guild banquets featuring food sacrificed to patron deities and sexual immorality (Rev 2:14, 20), creating dilemmas for Christian merchants and artisans. **Persecution and martyrdom**: While empire-wide persecution was rare, localized violence occurred, with "Antipas, my faithful witness" martyred at Pergamum (2:13), and Smyrna facing imminent suffering (2:10). **Wealth and compromise**: Laodicea's wealth ("I am rich... need nothing," 3:17) and Thyatira's toleration of immorality reflected accommodation pressures. **Prophetic authority**: Competing voices (Nicolaitans, Balaamites, Jezebel) claimed prophetic authority, requiring discernment. **Liturgical worship**: Revelation incorporates hymnic material, suggesting liturgical use (doxologies, songs of the Lamb, 24 elders' worship). **Jewish background**: Heavy Old Testament allusion (Daniel, Ezekiel, Isaiah, Zechariah), priestly/temple imagery, and exodus typology show Jewish apocalyptic roots despite Gentile majority recipients. **Honor-shame**: Roman honor culture is inverted—martyrs receive crowns (2:10), the slain Lamb rules (5:6-14), and apparent defeat is victory. **Numerology and symbolism**: Numbers carry symbolic weight (7=completeness, 12=people of God, 666=imperfection, 1,000=abundance), colors convey meaning (white=victory, red=bloodshed, black=death, pale=pestilence), and mythological imagery (dragon, beasts, whore) communicates theological truths about political-spiritual realities.

**Political Context**

Revelation presents the most politically provocative New Testament text, portraying Rome as satanic beast and Babylon the great whore, contrasting divine sovereignty with imperial pretensions. **Roman Empire** under Domitian (81-96 CE) demanded increasing recognition of emperor divinity, particularly in Asia Minor where imperial cult flourished. Domitian styled himself "dominus et deus" (lord and god), conflicting with Christian confession "Jesus is Lord." **Emperor cult** wasn't merely religious but political: loyalty demonstration, civic identity marker, and empire unity mechanism. Refusal signaled disloyalty, inviting legal consequences. **Persecution context**: Revelation reflects localized persecution (Antipas martyred at Pergamum, 2:13; Smyrna facing prison and death, 2:10) and economic pressure (commerce requiring cult participation, 13:16-17) rather than systematic empire-wide campaigns (later under Decius, Diocletian). **Political resistance**: Revelation's coded language (Babylon=Rome, beast=emperor, 666=Nero/Domitian, mark of beast=imperial cult participation) provided deniable political critique. The vision of Babylon's fall (ch. 18) celebrates Rome's future destruction with merchants and kings lamenting their profitable partnership. **Alternative political vision**: New Jerusalem descending (chs. 21-22) offers alternative to Rome's oppressive order—God dwelling with people, nations bringing glory, kings serving, tree of life healing nations. **Lamb's conquest**: Christ conquers not through military might but sacrificial death (5:5-6), subverting Roman conquest ideology and military triumph. **Judgment on empires**: Revelation prophesies judgment on political systems opposing God's reign, vindicating martyrs and establishing divine justice. **Christian political stance**: Neither accommodation (criticized in Laodicea, Thyatira) nor armed revolt (forbidden by Lamb's method), but faithful witness unto death, trusting God's ultimate justice. This political theology made Revelation subversive in Rome's eyes yet repeatedly relevant to Christians under various oppressive regimes throughout history.

**Economic Context**

Revelation addresses economic realities of Roman Asia Minor's prosperous cities while critiquing empire's economic exploitation and Christians' wealth temptations. **Imperial economy**: Rome's wealth depended on provinces like Asia Minor supplying goods, taxes, and tribute, creating prosperity for elites collaborating with empire. **Trade and commerce**: Chapter 18's extensive list of goods traded in "Babylon" (Rome)—gold, silver, jewels, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet, spices, wine, oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, slaves, and human souls—catalogs imperial economy's scope and moral bankruptcy (trade culminates in "human souls," revealing exploitation). **Imperial cult and economics**: Refusal to participate in emperor worship meant exclusion from trade guilds, markets, and commercial transactions, symbolized by the "mark of the beast" required to "buy or sell" (13:16-17). This wasn't literal mark but represents economic consequences of cult non-participation. **Wealth and complacency**: Laodicea's boast "I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing" (3:17) reflects actual wealth—Laodicea was a banking center, textile producer, and medical school site—but spiritual poverty. Sardis similarly had reputation but was dead (3:1). **Economic stratification**: Smyrna's poverty (2:9) contrasts with Laodicea's wealth (3:17), reflecting economic diversity in churches. **Merchant mourning**: Babylon/Rome's fall devastates merchants whose wealth depends on empire (18:11-19), showing economic interdependence with political systems Christians must resist. **Economic justice**: The martyrs' cry "How long?" (6:10) demands justice for economic and political exploitation. New Jerusalem's economy contrasts starkly: no temple needed (21:22), no sun/moon but God's glory (21:23), nations bringing glory (21:24-26), free water of life (22:1), tree of life freely accessible (22:2). Economic themes underscore Revelation's critique of Roman exploitation and offer eschatological economic justice and abundance.

**Religious Context**

Revelation engages multiple religious contexts—Jewish apocalyptic tradition, Greco-Roman polytheism, imperial cult, and emerging Christian theology—while establishing Christ's absolute sovereignty. **Jewish apocalyptic heritage**: Revelation draws heavily on Daniel, Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Zechariah, employing apocalyptic genre conventions: symbolic visions, angelic interpreters, cosmic conflict, periodization of history, eschatological judgment, and vindication of faithful. The book assumes Jewish scriptural literacy, with 400+ Old Testament allusions though no direct quotations. **Synagogue conflict**: References to "synagogue of Satan" (2:9; 3:9) reflect Jewish-Christian tensions, possibly Jewish denunciations of Christians to Roman authorities. **Imperial cult challenge**: The central conflict pits Christ worship against emperor worship. The beast demands worship (13:4, 8, 12), blasphemes God (13:5-6), and martyrs refusers (13:15). Christ's titles counter imperial claims: "King of kings and Lord of lords" (19:16) versus Caesar's lordship; Alpha and Omega (1:8) versus Rome's eternity claims. **Christian worship**: Heavenly liturgy models earthly worship—throne room scenes (chs. 4-5), hymnic material, doxologies, and the Lamb receiving worship establish proper orientation. **Christology**: Exalted Christology presents Christ as divine (sharing God's throne, receiving worship, creating and sustaining universe, judging humanity), risen and glorified (1:12-18), slain yet conquering Lamb (5:6), and returning King (19:11-16). **Pneumatology**: "What the Spirit says to the churches" (repeated seven times, chs. 2-3) emphasizes Spirit's prophetic voice. **Martyrdom theology**: "Those who die in the Lord" are blessed (14:13); martyrs receive white robes (6:11), reign with Christ (20:4-6), and vindication. Faithful witness unto death participates in Christ's victory. **Eschatology**: Millennium (1,000-year reign, 20:1-6), final judgment (great white throne, 20:11-15), new creation (new heaven and earth, 21:1), and New Jerusalem (21:2-22:5) articulate Christian hope. **Symbolic universe**: Revelation creates symbolic world ordering reality around divine sovereignty, cosmic conflict between God and Satan, and assured triumph of God's kingdom, providing meaning for persecuted believers navigating hostile empire.

## Revelation

### Book Introduction

**Historical Timeframe:** Revelation is dated to either Nero's reign (54-68 CE) or Domitian's reign (81-96 CE). Most scholars favor late dating (c. 95-96 CE) based on: Irenaeus's testimony (c. 180 CE) placing it "toward the end of Domitian's reign," developed church situations in seven churches (chs. 2-3), imperial cult intensity under Domitian, and linguistic/theological connections with Johannine epistles. Early dating advocates argue: Nero's persecution (64 CE) context, temple standing (11:1-2 implies pre-70 CE), and identification of "beast" with Nero (gematria of "Neron Caesar" = 666, 13:18). Regardless of date, Revelation addresses Christians facing pressure to participate in imperial cult, economic exclusion for refusing emperor worship ("mark of beast," 13:16-17), and martyrdom (2:13, 6:9-11). The book responds to crisis: How should Christians respond to Roman power's totalitarian claims? Revelation declares Rome's beastly nature, assures God's sovereign control, promises martyrs' vindication, and envisions new creation where God dwells with humanity.

**Author and Audience:** The book identifies its author as "John" (1:1, 4, 9; 22:8), exiled on Patmos "on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus" (1:9). Church tradition identifies this John with the apostle and Fourth Gospel author, though modern scholars debate this: Revelation's Greek is rough compared to John's Gospel, theology differs (realized vs. futuristic eschatology), and no claim to apostolic witness appears. Proposals include: John the apostle, John the Elder (distinct figure mentioned by Papias), or unknown John (common name). Regardless, the author is a Jewish-Christian prophet (1:3, 22:9) deeply versed in Hebrew Bible (over 500 allusions), writing from Patmos exile to "the seven churches in Asia" (1:4, 11): Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea (chs. 2-3). These churches face persecution (Smyrna, Philadelphia), imperial cult pressure (Pergamum "where Satan's throne is," likely emperor worship temple), internal compromise (Ephesus, Sardis, Laodicea), and false teaching (Thyatira's "Jezebel"). John writes to encourage perseverance, resist imperial cult, and assure Christ's victory.

**Key Themes:** **Christ's Sovereignty**: Jesus is "ruler of kings on earth" (1:5), "Alpha and Omega" (1:8, 22:13), "King of kings and Lord of lords" (19:16), challenging Roman emperor's claims. **Imperial Cult Critique**: The beast (ch. 13) represents Rome demanding worship, economically excluding Christians (13:16-17), and persecuting saints. Babylon (chs. 17-18) represents Rome's seductive, idolatrous, violent empire. **Martyrdom Theology**: Faithful witness unto death receives vindication (2:10, 6:9-11, 7:13-17, 20:4); martyrs' blood cries for justice (6:10). **Cosmic Conflict**: Spiritual warfare between God/Lamb and dragon/beast/false prophet unfolds, with assured divine victory (12:7-12, 19:11-21, 20:7-10). **New Creation**: Revelation climaxes not with souls in heaven but new heaven and earth (21:1-22:5), New Jerusalem descending, God dwelling with humanity (21:3), with river of life, tree of life, and nations healed (22:1-2). **Worship**: Heavenly worship scenes (4-5, 7, 11, 15, 19) present God and Lamb receiving adoration, contrasting idolatry's emptiness. **Divine Justice**: God's judgments (seals, trumpets, bowls) execute justice against oppressors, vindicate martyrs, and purge evil, though offering repentance opportunities (9:20-21, 16:9, 11). **Already/Not Yet**: Christ conquered (5:5, "Lion of Judah"), but final consummation awaits his return (22:20).

**Archaeological Relevance:** **Seven Churches Sites**: Extensive excavations at all seven cities provide archaeological context: **Ephesus** (theater, library, Artemis temple site), **Smyrna** (modern Izmir), **Pergamum** (massive Zeus altar, Asclepius healing cult, imperial cult temple—"Satan's throne"), **Thyatira** (trade guilds implicated in 2:20's compromises), **Sardis** (temple of Artemis-Cybele, synagogue), **Philadelphia** (earthquake-prone, explaining "pillar" promise 3:12), **Laodicea** (wealthy city with tepid aqueduct water, explaining "lukewarm" critique 3:16). **Imperial Cult**: Archaeological evidence throughout Asia Minor—temples, altars, statues, inscriptions, coins—documents emperor worship's pervasiveness, contextualizing Revelation's resistance. **Patmos**: Small Aegean island where John was exiled (1:9); traditional sites include cave of John's visions and later monastery. **Economic Controls**: Roman trade guild systems requiring emperor cult participation evidence "mark of beast" economic exclusion (13:16-17). **Roman Imperial Imagery**: Coins, statues, and inscriptions depicting emperors as divine, wearing crowns (diadems), receiving worship illustrate imagery Revelation subverts by ascribing to Christ.

**Structure:** **Prologue (1:1-8)**: Title, beatitude, greeting. **Vision of Christ (1:9-20)**: Glorious Christ among lampstands commissions John. **Letters to Seven Churches (2:1-3:22)**: Individual messages with commendation/rebuke/promise pattern. **Heavenly Throne Vision (4:1-5:14)**: God enthroned, 24 elders, four living creatures, Lamb takes scroll. **Seven Seals (6:1-8:5)**: Four horsemen, martyrs, cosmic signs, seventh seal's silence. **Seven Trumpets (8:6-11:19)**: Plagues, demonic locusts, two witnesses martyred and vindicated. **Spiritual Warfare (12:1-14:20)**: Woman, dragon, beasts, 144,000, harvest. **Seven Bowls (15:1-16:21)**: Final plagues, Armageddon. **Babylon's Fall (17:1-19:10)**: Great prostitute judged, lament over Rome. **Final Victory (19:11-20:15)**: Christ conquers, millennium, Satan's defeat, final judgment. **New Creation (21:1-22:5)**: New heaven/earth, New Jerusalem, river/tree of life, God dwelling with humanity. **Epilogue (22:6-21)**: Coming soon, warnings, benediction. Revelation's apocalyptic genre uses symbolic imagery drawn from Daniel, Ezekiel, Isaiah to encourage persecuted Christians that despite appearances, Christ reigns and will consummate his kingdom.

### Revelation Chapter 7

And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,
Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.
And I heard the number of them which were sealed:
and there were
 sealed an hundred
and forty
and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.
Of the tribe of Juda
were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben
were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad
were sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Aser
were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nepthalim
were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses
were sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Simeon
were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi
were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar
were sealed twelve thousand.
Of the tribe of Zabulon
were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph
were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin
were sealed twelve thousand.
After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;
And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.
And all the angels stood round about the throne, and
about
 the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,
Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might,
be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.
And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?
And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.
They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.
For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.


### Revelation Chapter 8

And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.
And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.
And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer
it
 with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
And the smoke of the incense,
which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand.
And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast
it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;
And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;
And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.
And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.
And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!


### Revelation Chapter 9

And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.
And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment
was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.
And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
And the shapes of the locusts
were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads
were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces
were as the faces of men.
And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as
the teeth of lions.
And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings
was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.
And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power
was to hurt men five months.
And they had a king over them,
which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue
is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath
his name Apollyon.
One woe is past;
and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.
And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,
Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.
And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.
And the number of the army of the horsemen
were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.
And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses
were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.
By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.
For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails
were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.
And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:
Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.


### Revelation Chapter 10

And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow
was upon his head, and his face
was
 as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and
his left
foot on the earth,
And cried with a loud voice, as
when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.
And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.
And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,
And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:
But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go
and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.
And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take
it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.

### Revelation Chapter 11

And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.
But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty
and two months.
And I will give
power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred
and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.
These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.
And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.
These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.
And their dead bodies
shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.
And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.
And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.
And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.
And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
The second woe is past;
and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.
And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become
the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,
Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.
And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.
And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.


### Revelation Chapter 12

And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:
And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.
And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.
And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and
to his throne.
And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred
and
 threescore days.
And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.
And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.
Therefore rejoice,
ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.
And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man
child.
And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.
And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.


### Revelation Chapter 13

And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.
And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as
the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.
And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.
And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who
is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?
And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty
and
 two months.
And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.
And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.
And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
If any man have an ear, let him hear.
He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,
And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by
the means of
 those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number
is Six hundred threescore
and six.


### Revelation Chapter 14

And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty
and four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads.
And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:
And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred
and forty
and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.
These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men,
being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.
And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.
And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,
Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive
his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
Here is the patience of the saints: here
are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.
And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed
are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.
And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud
one
 sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.
And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.
And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast
it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand
and six hundred furlongs.


### Revelation Chapter 15

And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.
And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark,
and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.
And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous
are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true
are thy ways, thou King of saints.
Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for
thou
 only
art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.
And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:
And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.
And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.

### Revelation Chapter 16

And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and
upon them which worshipped his image.
And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead
man: and every living soul died in the sea.
And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.
And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.
For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.
And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous
are thy judgments.
And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.
And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.
And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,
And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.
And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.
And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs
come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles,
which
 go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed
is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.
And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.
And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.
And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake,
and so great.
And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven,
every stone
 about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.


### Revelation Chapter 17

And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:
With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:
And upon her forehead
was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.
And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.
The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
And here
is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.
And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is,
and
 the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.
And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.
And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.
These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.
These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him
are called, and chosen, and faithful.
And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.
For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.


### Revelation Chapter 18

And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.
And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.
For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.
And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.
Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.
How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong
is
 the Lord God who judgeth her.
And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.
And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:
The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,
And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.
And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.
The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!
For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,
And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What
city is like unto this great city!
And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.
Rejoice over her,
thou heaven, and
ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.
And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast
it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.
And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft
he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;
And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.
And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.


### Revelation Chapter 19

And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:
For true and righteous
are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.
And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.
And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.
And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.
And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.
Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.
And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed
are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.
And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See
thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him
was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
His eyes
were as a flame of fire, and on his head
were
 many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
And he
was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
And the armies
which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
And he hath on
his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;
That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all
men, both free and bond, both small and great.
And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.
And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.
And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which
sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.


### Revelation Chapter 20

And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.
And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and
I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received
his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This
is the first resurrection.
Blessed and holy
is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,
And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom
is as the sand of the sea.
And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet
are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is
the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

### Revelation Chapter 21

And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God
is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them,
and be their God.
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.
And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,
Having the glory of God: and her light
was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
And had a wall great and high,
and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are
the names
 of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.
And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred
and forty
and four cubits,
according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
And the building of the wall of it was
of jasper: and the city
was pure gold, like unto clear glass.
And the foundations of the wall of the city
were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation
was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;
The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
And the twelve gates
were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city
was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.
And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb
is the light thereof.
And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.
And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.
And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither
whatsoever worketh abomination, or
maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
