2. **Author and Audience:**
   - Traditional authorship claims
   - Critical scholarship perspectives
   - Intended recipients
   - Geographical/cultural setting

3. **Key Themes:**
   - 4-6 major theological/narrative themes
   - Each theme explained with biblical references
   - Distinctive contributions to biblical theology

4. **Archaeological Relevance:**
   - Specific excavations, inscriptions, artifacts
   - Manuscript evidence (papyri, codices)
   - Corroborating extra-biblical sources
   - Geographic/cultural context

5. **Structure:**
   - Book outline with chapter ranges
   - Major sections identified
   - Narrative flow or argument progression

### Quality Standards

- **Scholarly Balance:** Present both traditional and critical views fairly
- **Biblical References:** Include chapter:verse citations for themes
- **Length:** ~1,200-1,800 words per major book, ~600-1,000 for minor books
