# Continue Biblical Narrative Enhancement

You are continuing the creation of the Jewish Biblical Narrative Enhanced document. This is a multi-session project requiring consistent high quality.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

1. **NEVER create a new file** - Always append to `jewish_biblical_narrative_enhanced.md`
2. **MAXIMIZE token usage** - Use as many tokens as possible each session
3. **Maintain 98%+ quality score** - Archaeological accuracy, scholarly balance, theological depth
4. **Commit and push at end of session** - Always save progress to repository

## STEP 1: Read Current Progress

First, read these files to understand where to resume:
- `CURRENT_PROGRESS.md` - Shows exact stopping point and next sections needed
- Check the `## RESUME POINT` section for the exact book/section to continue

## STEP 2: Quality Standards (98%+ Actuality Score)

Each contextual analysis section MUST include ALL 6 components:

### 1. Narrative Summary (150-250 words)
- What happens in these chapters
- Key events, characters, themes
- Clear, engaging prose

### 2. Historical & Archaeological Context (250-400 words)
**CRITICAL: Name specific evidence - no generic claims**
- **Named artifacts**: Steles, inscriptions, tablets (e.g., "Mesha Stele", "Lachish Letters")
- **Named sites**: Tells, excavations (e.g., "Tell es-Sultan", "Khirbet Qeiyafa")
- **Ancient sources**: Mesopotamian texts, Egyptian records, Ugaritic parallels
- **Dating debates**: Present multiple scholarly views fairly
- **Balance**: Traditional and critical scholarship perspectives

### 3. Cultural Practices Reflected (200-350 words)
- Ancient Near Eastern customs with parallels
- Daily life, social structures, family dynamics
- Religious practices and cultic activities
- Economic and agricultural contexts

### 4. Political Situation (200-350 words)
- Geopolitical context of the ancient world
- Kings, empires, treaties, vassal relationships
- Historical events from surrounding nations
- Internal Israelite/Jewish political dynamics

### 5. Theological Themes (250-400 words)
- Major theological concepts and divine attributes
- Covenant implications and development
- Wisdom traditions, prophetic themes, or narrative theology
- How God is portrayed and what is revealed about divine character

### 6. Connection to Broader Narrative (250-400 words)
- How this section fits the overall biblical story
- Connections to other books (forward and backward)
- Intertextual echoes and literary patterns
- New Testament fulfillment where applicable

## STEP 3: Archaeological Citation Requirements

**Every section MUST cite at least 3-5 specific archaeological items:**

Examples of acceptable citations:
- "The Dead Sea Scrolls (4QProverbs) preserve variant readings..."
- "Excavations at Gezer revealed the famous calendar inscription..."
- "The Elephantine Papyri from 5th century BCE Egypt show..."
- "Cuneiform wisdom texts from Nippur parallel..."
- "The Instruction of Amenemope shows direct literary dependence..."

**NOT acceptable (too generic):**
- "Archaeological evidence supports..."
- "Ancient texts show..."
- "Scholars have found..."

## STEP 4: Session Workflow

1. **Read** `CURRENT_PROGRESS.md` to find resume point
2. **Open** `jewish_biblical_narrative_enhanced.md` and scroll to the end
3. **Continue** from the exact stopping point with next section(s)
4. **Write** as many complete sections as possible (maximize tokens)
5. **Update** `CURRENT_PROGRESS.md` with new completion status
6. **Commit** with descriptive message: "Complete [Book] contextual analyses ([N] sections)"
7. **Push** to repository

## STEP 5: Format Consistency

Match the existing document style:
- Use `###` for section headers within contextual analyses
- Use `##` for book-level headers
- Maintain consistent spacing and markdown formatting
- Keep the established voice and tone

## STEP 6: Update Progress Tracker

After each session, update `CURRENT_PROGRESS.md`:
1. Update completion percentages in the table
2. Mark completed books/sections
3. Update the `## RESUME POINT` section with exact next starting point
4. Add session summary with archaeological evidence cited
5. Update "Next Session: Start Here" guidance

## CURRENT QUEUE (in order)

1. **Proverbs** - 6 sections needed
