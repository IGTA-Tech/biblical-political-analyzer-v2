# Era 1: Apostolic Era (4 BC - 100 AD)

## Overview

The Apostolic Era represents the foundational period of Christianity, spanning from the birth of Jesus of Nazareth (c. 4 BC) through the death of the last apostle, traditionally John (c. 100 AD). This era witnessed the emergence of Christianity from within Second Temple Judaism, the establishment of the early church, and the beginning of the parting of ways between Judaism and Christianity.

This period is characterized by several transformative developments:
- The life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth
- The establishment of the Jerusalem church and the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire
- The transition from a predominantly Jewish movement to an increasingly Gentile faith
- The destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, fundamentally reshaping both Judaism and Christianity
- The writing of the New Testament documents

The era takes place within the broader context of Roman Imperial rule over Judea, beginning with Herod the Great's reign and continuing through various Roman governors, the First Jewish-Roman War (66-73 AD), and the consolidation of Rabbinic Judaism.

The charge was sedition ("King of the Jews"). Tacitus (Annals 15.44) and Josephus (Antiquities 18.3.3) both reference Jesus's execution under Pilate.

**Key Scriptures Fulfilled (Christian Understanding):**

**Isaiah 53:1-12 (Suffering Servant):**
> "Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief... Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows... But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed."

My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet. I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me. They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture."

And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered."

### 6. Stoning of Stephen (c. 34 AD)
**Date:** c. 34 AD
**Location:** Jerusalem
**Significance:** First Christian martyr; triggered persecution that scattered believers throughout Judea and Samaria, spreading the gospel.

**Historical Context:** Stephen was one of seven deacons appointed to serve the Hellenistic Jewish widows. His speech in Acts 7 critiqued the Temple establishment and provoked violent reaction.

### 10. Destruction of the Temple (70 AD)
**Date:** 70 AD (9th of Av)
**Location:** Jerusalem
**Significance:** Catastrophic event for Judaism; ended Temple worship and sacrifice; accelerated separation between Judaism and Christianity.

**Historical Context:** The First Jewish-Roman War (66-73 AD) culminated in the Roman siege and destruction of Jerusalem under General Titus. The Temple, the center of Jewish religious life, was burned and demolished. This event fundamentally reshaped Judaism, leading to the dominance of Rabbinic/Pharisaic Judaism, and had profound implications for Christianity.

**Primary Sources:**
- Josephus, *The Jewish War* (Books 5-6) - Eyewitness account
- *The Genuine Works of Flavius Josephus* (Internet Archive, 1809 edition)

**Key Scripture:**
- Mark 13:1-2 (Jesus's prediction of Temple destruction)

### 12. Persecution under Nero (64-68 AD)
**Date:** 64-68 AD
**Location:** Rome
**Significance:** First official Roman persecution of Christians; traditionally, Peter and Paul were martyred during this period.

**Historical Context:** Following the Great Fire of Rome (64 AD), Emperor Nero scapegoated Christians. Tacitus (Annals 15.44) describes Christians being covered in animal skins and torn by dogs, or crucified and set aflame as human torches. This persecution established a precedent for state-sponsored violence against Christians.

---

### 13. Fall of Masada (73 AD)
**Date:** 73 AD (or possibly 74 AD)
**Location:** Masada, Judean Desert
**Significance:** Final act of the First Jewish-Roman War; became a symbol of Jewish resistance.

**Historical Context:** After Jerusalem fell, the last Jewish rebels held out at the fortress of Masada. When Roman forces finally breached the walls, they found that most of the defenders had committed mass suicide rather than be captured. This event, described by Josephus, became a powerful symbol in later Jewish memory.

**Primary Source:**
- Josephus, *The Jewish War* 7.8-9

---

### 14. Council of Jamnia (c. 90 AD)
**Date:** c. 90 AD
**Location:** Jamnia (Yavneh), Judea
**Significance:** Traditional date for the consolidation of the Hebrew Bible canon and the restructuring of Judaism after the Temple's destruction.

**Historical Context:** The "Council of Jamnia" concept has been reassessed by modern scholars. While there was an important academy at Yavneh led by Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai, the idea of a formal council that "closed" the Hebrew canon is now considered oversimplified. Nevertheless, this period saw crucial developments in the formation of Rabbinic Judaism.

**Jewish Sources:**

**Pirkei Avot 1:1 (Chain of Tradition):**
> "Moses received the Torah at Sinai and transmitted it to Joshua, Joshua to the elders, and the elders to the prophets, and the prophets to the Men of the Great Assembly. They said three things: Be patient in [the administration of] justice, raise many disciples and make a fence round the Torah."

## Multi-Perspective Analysis

### Event: Crucifixion and Resurrection

#### Eastern Orthodox Perspective
The crucifixion and resurrection constitute the Paschal Mystery through which Christ trampled down death by death. The resurrection is the victory over Hades and the restoration of humanity to communion with God. Orthodox theology emphasizes theosis (divinization) as the fruit of Christ's saving work. The resurrection is celebrated as Pascha, the central feast of the liturgical year.

#### Roman Catholic Perspective
Christ's death on the cross was a true sacrifice that redeemed humanity from sin. The resurrection vindicated Jesus as the Son of God and opened the way to eternal life. Catholic teaching emphasizes both the expiatory nature of Christ's death (satisfaction for sin) and its revelatory aspect (manifestation of divine love). The Mass re-presents this sacrifice sacramentally.

#### Protestant Perspective
Protestant theology emphasizes justification by faith alone in Christ's atoning work. The crucifixion is understood primarily through penal substitutionary atonement - Christ bearing the penalty for human sin. The resurrection confirms Jesus's identity as Messiah and Lord and ensures believers' future resurrection. Sola Scriptura grounds these doctrines in biblical texts like Romans 3-5.

#### Jewish Perspective
Traditional Judaism does not accept Jesus as the Messiah, as he did not fulfill messianic expectations (rebuilding the Temple, gathering exiles, bringing world peace). The crucifixion represents the death of a Jewish teacher who made claims that mainstream Judaism rejected. The resurrection is not accepted as historical fact. However, Jewish scholarship acknowledges Jesus as a significant first-century Jewish figure.

#### Academic/Secular Perspective
Scholars generally accept the historicity of Jesus's crucifixion under Pontius Pilate as well-attested. The resurrection is a matter of faith rather than historical verification, though the emergence of resurrection belief among Jesus's followers is historically significant and requires explanation. Various theories exist (hallucination, cognitive dissonance resolution, genuine religious experience) to explain the disciples' conviction. The impact of resurrection belief on subsequent history is undeniable.

### Event: Council of Jerusalem (49 AD)

#### Eastern Orthodox Perspective
The Council of Jerusalem represents the first exercise of conciliar authority guided by the Holy Spirit. The decision freed Gentile converts from Jewish ceremonial law while maintaining moral requirements. It established the pattern of ecumenical councils that would define Orthodox Christianity. The council's formula - "it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us" - reflects Spirit-led decision-making.

#### Roman Catholic Perspective
The Council of Jerusalem demonstrates apostolic authority, particularly the role of Peter (who spoke first) and James (who gave the final decision). It established precedent for the magisterium's authority to interpret revelation and make binding decisions. The council showed how the church, guided by the Spirit, can develop doctrine while remaining faithful to Christ's teaching.

#### Protestant Perspective
The Council of Jerusalem illustrates the early church's commitment to the gospel of grace over works-righteousness. It affirmed that salvation is by faith alone, not through Torah observance. Protestant interpretation emphasizes the biblical basis of the decision and its alignment with Paul's gospel. Some Protestants see it as a model for congregational or presbyterian polity rather than hierarchical authority.

#### Jewish Perspective
From a Jewish perspective, the council represents the moment when the Jesus movement decisively broke with Judaism by abandoning circumcision and Torah observance for Gentile adherents. This decision made Christianity a different religion rather than a Jewish sect. Some Jewish scholars view it as the beginning of the "parting of the ways."

#### Academic/Secular Perspective
Scholars debate whether Acts 15 and Galatians 2 describe the same event. The council represents an attempt to resolve tensions between Jewish and Gentile Christians that had significant implications for Christianity's development. The compromise (minimal Gentile requirements) may have satisfied neither Paul's radical position nor the conservative Jewish-Christian view completely. The council's historical significance lies in its role in defining Christianity's relationship to Judaism.

---

### Event: Destruction of the Temple (70 AD)

#### Eastern Orthodox Perspective
The Temple's destruction fulfilled Jesus's prophecy (Luke 21:6) and signified the end of the Old Covenant sacrificial system. Orthodox theology sees this as divine judgment confirming Christianity as the true Israel. The church becomes the new Temple, and the Eucharist replaces animal sacrifice. However, Orthodox theology also acknowledges the tragedy for the Jewish people.

#### Roman Catholic Perspective
Catholic teaching interprets the Temple's destruction as God's judgment on Israel's rejection of the Messiah (Matthew 23:37-24:2) while also acknowledging its complexity. Vatican II's *Nostra Aetate* (1965) repudiated the idea of collective Jewish guilt. The destruction is seen as confirmation that the Old Covenant has found its fulfillment in Christ, whose sacrifice supersedes Temple worship.

#### Protestant Perspective
Many Protestant interpretations see the Temple's destruction as prophetic fulfillment and divine confirmation of the New Covenant. Dispensationalist theology views it as ending the Jewish age until a future restoration. Reformed theology sees it as judgment confirming the abrogation of ceremonial law. All Protestant traditions recognize its massive historical significance for both Judaism and Christianity.

#### Jewish Perspective
The Temple's destruction (Churban) is the central catastrophe of ancient Jewish history, commemorated annually on Tisha B'Av. It ended the sacrificial system and priesthood, transforming Judaism into its rabbinic form. The disaster is attributed to various factors in rabbinic literature, including "baseless hatred" among Jews (Yoma 9b). It represents loss but also resilience - Judaism survived and adapted through Torah study, prayer, and ethical living.

#### Academic/Secular Perspective
Historians view the Temple's destruction as the culmination of Jewish-Roman tensions and the failed revolt of 66-73 AD. Josephus provides the primary eyewitness account. The event had profound consequences: reshaping Judaism around synagogue and rabbi, accelerating Christianity's separation from Judaism, and creating the conditions for Rabbinic Judaism's emergence. Archaeological evidence from Jerusalem confirms the destruction's extent.

## Conclusion

The Apostolic Era (4 BC - 100 AD) represents the formative period of Christianity and a transformative time for Judaism. From the birth of Jesus through the death of the last apostle, this century witnessed:

1. The emergence of Christianity from within Second Temple Judaism
2. The expansion of the Jesus movement from Jerusalem to the ends of the Roman Empire
3. The development of key Christian doctrines and the writing of the New Testament
4. The destruction of the Temple and the transformation of Judaism into its rabbinic form
5. The beginning of the "parting of the ways" between Judaism and Christianity

The events, figures, and texts of this era continue to shape religious thought and practice for billions of people worldwide. Understanding this period requires engagement with multiple perspectives - Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and academic - each bringing valuable insights to the historical and theological questions it raises.
